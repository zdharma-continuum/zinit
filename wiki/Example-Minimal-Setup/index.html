<ul>
<li><code>wait</code> – load 0 seconds (about 5 ms exactly) after prompt (<strong>Turbo mode</strong>),</li>
<li><code>lucid</code> – silence the under-prompt messages ("<code>Loaded {name of the plugin}</code>"),</li>
<li><code>light-mode</code> – load the plugin in <code>light</code> mode, in which the tracking of
   plugin (i.e. activity report gathering, accessible via the <code>zinit report
   {plugin-spec}</code> subcommand) is being disabled; note that for Turbo mode, the
   performance gains are almost <code>0</code>, so in this mode you can load all plugins
   with the tracking, i.e.: the <code>light-mode</code> ice can be removed from the
   command, </li>
<li><code>atpull''</code> – execute after updating the plugin – the command in the ice will
   install any new completions,</li>
<li><code>atinit''</code> – execute code before loading plugin,</li>
<li><code>atload''</code> – execute code after loading plugin,</li>
<li><code>zicompinit</code> – equals to <code>autoload compinit; compinit</code>,</li>
<li><code>zicdreplay</code> – execute <code>compdef …</code> calls that plugins did – they were
   recorded, so that <code>compinit</code> can be called later (<code>compinit</code> provides the
   <code>compdef</code> function, so it must be ran before issuing the taken-over
   <code>compdef</code>s with <code>zicdreplay</code>),</li>
<li>syntax-highlighting plugins (like
   <a href="https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting"><strong>fast-syntax-highlighting</strong></a>
   or
   <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting"><strong>zsh-syntax-highlighting</strong></a>)
   theoretically expect to be loaded last, even after the completion
   initialization (i.e.  <code>compinit</code> function), however, in practice, you just
   have to ensure that such plugin is loaded after plugins that are issuing
   <code>compdef</code>s – which basically means completions that aren't using the
   underscore-starting function file; the completion initialization still has to
   be performed before syntax-highlighting plugin, hence the <code>atinit''</code> ice,
   which will load <code>compinit</code> right before loading the plugin,</li>
<li>the syntax-highlighting and suggestions plugins are loaded early for a better
   user experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same setup but without using Turbo mode (i.e. no <code>wait''</code> ice) and without
the <a href="https://zdharma.org/zinit/wiki/For-Syntax/">for-syntax</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="zsh">zinit ice blockf atpull'zinit creinstall -q .'
zinit light zsh-users/zsh-completions

autoload compinit
compinit

zinit light zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting

zinit light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
</code></pre>

<p>Without Turbo the syntax-highlighting plugin can be loaded at the end, as it
doesn't make any difference (the prompt will appear after loading all objects,
anyway).</p>
