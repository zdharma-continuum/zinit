<p>If you create a Docker image that uses Zplugin, or want to install Turbo-loaded
plugins before the shell starts interactively, you can invoke the
zplugin-scheduler function in such a way, that it:</p>
<ul>
<li>installs plugins without waiting for the prompt (i.e. it's script friendly),</li>
<li>installs <strong>all</strong> plugins instantly, without respecting the <code>wait''</code> argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish this, use <code>burst</code> argument and call <code>-zplg-scheduler</code> function.
Example <code>Dockerfile</code> entry:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">RUN zsh -i -c -- '-zplg-scheduler burst || true'
</code></pre>
<p>An example <code>Dockerfile</code> can be found
<a href="https://github.com/robobenklein/configs/blob/master/Dockerfile"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
