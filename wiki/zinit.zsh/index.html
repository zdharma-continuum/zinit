<pre><code class="language-text">Searches for timeout tasks, executes them. There's an array of tasks
waiting for execution, this scheduler manages them, detects which ones
should be run at current moment, decides to remove (or not) them from
the array after execution.

$1 - if &quot;following&quot;, then it is non-first (second and more)
invocation of the scheduler; this results in chain of `sched'
invocations that results in repetitive @zinit-scheduler activity

if &quot;burst&quot;, then all tasks are marked timeout and executed one
by one; this is handy if e.g. a docker image starts up and
needs to install all turbo-mode plugins without any hesitation
(delay), i.e. &quot;burst&quot; allows to run package installations from
