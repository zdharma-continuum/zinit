<h1 id="zsh_plugin_standard">Zsh Plugin Standard<a class="headerlink" href="#zsh_plugin_standard" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>This document defines the Zsh Plugin Standard. Zinit fully supports
this standard.</p>
<p>This document is also available as a
<a href="http://zdharma.org/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard.pdf"><strong>PDF</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="what_is_a_zsh_plugin">What Is A Zsh Plugin?<a class="headerlink" href="#what_is_a_zsh_plugin" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Historically, Zsh plugins were first defined by Oh My Zsh. They provide for a
way to package together files that extend or configure the shell’s functionality
in a particular way.</p>
<p>At a simple level, a plugin:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Has its directory added to <code>$fpath</code> (<a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Autoloading-Functions"><strong>Zsh
  documentation</strong></a>).
  This is being done either by a plugin manager or by the plugin itself (see
  <a href="#546_plugin_manager_activity_indicator">5<sup>th</sup> section</a> for more information).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has its first <code>*.plugin.zsh</code> file sourced (or <code>*.zsh</code>, <code>init.zsh</code>, <code>*.sh</code>,
   these are non-standard).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first point allows plugins to provide completions and functions that are
loaded via Zsh’s <code>autoload</code> mechanism (a single function per-file).</p>
<p>From a more broad perspective, a plugin consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A directory containing various files (main script, autoload functions,
   completions, Makefiles, backend programs, documentation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sourcable script that obtains the path to its directory via <code>$0</code> (see the
   <a href="#146_standardized_0_handling"><strong>next section</strong></a> for a related enhancement proposal).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Github (or other site) repository identified by two components
   <strong>username</strong>/<strong>pluginname</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A software package containing any type of command line artifacts – when used
   with advanced plugin managers that have hooks, can run Makefiles, add
   directories to <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Below follow proposed enhancements and codifications of the definition of a "Zsh
plugin" and the actions of plugin managers – the proposed standardization. They
cover the information of how to write a Zsh plugin.</p>
<h2 id="1_standardized_0_handling">1. Standardized $0 Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#1_standardized_0_handling" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>To get the plugin’s location, plugins should do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">0=&quot;${${ZERO:-${0:#$ZSH_ARGZERO}}:-${(%):-%N}}&quot;
0=&quot;${${(M)0:#/*}:-$PWD/$0}&quot;

# Then ${0:h} to get plugin’s directory
</code></pre>
<p>The one-line code above will:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be backwards-compatible with normal <code>$0</code> setting and usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>ZERO</code> if it’s not empty,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the plugin manager will be easily able to alter effective <code>$0</code> before
    loading a plugin,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this allows for e.g. <code>eval "$(&lt;plugin)"</code>, which can be faster
    than <code>source</code>
    (<a href="http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2017/msg01827.html"><strong>comparison</strong></a>,
    note that it’s not for a compiled script).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>$0</code> if it doesn’t contain the path to the Zsh binary,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>plugin manager will still be able to set <code>$0</code>, although more difficultly
    (requires <code>unsetopt function_argzero</code> before sourcing plugin script, and
    <code>0=…​</code> assignment),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>unsetopt function_argzero</code> will be detected (it causes <code>$0</code> not to
    contain plugin-script path, but path to Zsh binary, if not overwritten
    by a <code>0=…​</code> assignment),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>setopt posix_argzero</code> will be detected (as above).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>%N</code> prompt expansion flag, which always gives absolute path to script,</p>
<ul>
<li>plugin manager cannot alter this (no advanced loading of plugin
    is possible), but simple plugin-file sourcing (without a plugin
    manager) will be saved from breaking caused by the mentioned
    <code>*_argzero</code> options, so this is a very good last-resort
    fallback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, in the second line, it will ensure that <code>$0</code> contains an absolute
   path by prepending it with <code>$PWD</code> if necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal is flexibility, with essential motivation to support <code>eval
"$(&lt;plugin)"</code> and definitely solve <code>setopt no_function_argzero</code> and <code>setopt
posix_argzero</code> cases.</p>
<p>A plugin manager will be even able to convert a plugin to a function (author
implemented such proof of concept functionality, it’s fully possible – also in
an automatic fashion), but performance differences of this are yet unclear. It
might however provide a use case.</p>
<p>The last, 5<sup>th</sup> point also allows to use the <code>$0</code> handling in scripts (i.e.
runnables with the hashbang <code>#!…</code>) to get the directory in which the script
file resides.</p>
<p>The assignment uses quoting to make it resilient to combination of <code>GLOB_SUBST</code>
and <code>GLOB_ASSIGN</code> options. It's a standard snippet of code, so it has to be
always working. When you'll set e.g.: the <code>zsh</code> emulation in a function, you in
general don't have to quote assignments.</p>

<li>
<p>Plugin managers: Zinit, Zgen (after and if the
   <a href="https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen/pull/124"><strong>PR</strong></a> will be merged)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plugins:

<h2 id="2_unload_function">2. Unload Function<a class="headerlink" href="#2_unload_function" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>If a plugin is named e.g. <code>kalc</code> (and is available via <code>an-user/kalc</code>
plugin-ID), then it can provide a function, <code>kalc_plugin_unload</code>, that can be
called by a plugin manager to undo the effects of loading that plugin.</p>
<p>A plugin manager can implement its own tracking of changes made by a plugin so
this is in general optional. However, to properly unload e.g. a prompt,
dedicated tracking (easy to do for the plugin creator) can provide better,
predictable results. Any special, uncommon effects of loading a plugin are
possible to undo only by a dedicated function.</p>
<p>However, an interesting compromise approach is available – to withdraw only the
special effects of loading a plugin via the dedicated, plugin-provided function
and leave the rest to the plugin manager. The value of such approach is that
maintaining of such function (if it is to withdraw <strong>all</strong> plugin side-effects)
can be a daunting task requiring constant monitoring of it during the plugin
develoment process.</p>
<h5 id="adoption_status_1">Adoption Status<a class="headerlink" href="#adoption_status_1" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<ol>
<li>One plugin manager, Zinit, implements plugin unloading and calls the
   function.</li>
<li>One plugin, <code>romkatv/powerlevel10k</code>, is</li>
<li>
<p>Two plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>romkatv/powerlevel10k</code>, is
  <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/f17081ca/internal/p10k.zsh#L5390"><strong>using</strong></a>
  the function to execute a specific task: shutdown of the binary, background
  <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus"><strong>gitstatus</strong></a> demon, with a very good
  results,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>agkozak/agkozak-zsh-prompt</code>, is
  <a href="https://github.com/agkozak/agkozak-zsh-prompt/commit/08b5879a"><strong>using</strong></a>
  the function for the full unload of the theme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3_zsh-plugin-run-on-unload_call">3. <code>@zsh-plugin-run-on-unload</code> Call<a class="headerlink" href="#3_zsh-plugin-run-on-unload_call" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The plugin manager can provide a function <code>@zsh-plugin-run-on-unload</code> which
has the following call syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">@zsh-plugin-run-on-unload &quot;{code-snippet-1}&quot; &quot;{code-snippet-2}&quot; …
</code></pre>
<p>The function registers pieces of code to be run by the plugin manager <strong>on
unload of the plugin</strong>. The execution of the code should be done by the <code>eval</code>
builtin in the same order as they are passed to the call.</p>
<p>The code should be executed in the plugin's directory, in the current shell.</p>
<p>The mechanism thus provides another way, side to the <a href="#246_unload_function">unload
function</a>, for the plugin to participate in the process of
unloading it.</p>
<h5 id="adoption_status_2">Adoption Status<a class="headerlink" href="#adoption_status_2" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<p>It's a recent addition to the standard and only one plugin manager, Zinit,
implements it.</p>
<h2 id="4_zsh-plugin-run-on-update_call">4. <code>@zsh-plugin-run-on-update</code> Call<a class="headerlink" href="#4_zsh-plugin-run-on-update_call" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The plugin manager can provide a function <code>@zsh-plugin-run-on-update</code> which
has the following call syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">@zsh-plugin-run-on-update &quot;{code-snippet-1}&quot; &quot;{code-snippet-2}&quot; …
</code></pre>

<p>It's a recent addition to the standard and only one plugin manager, Zinit,

<h2 id="5_plugin_manager_activity_indicator">5. Plugin Manager Activity Indicator<a class="headerlink" href="#5_plugin_manager_activity_indicator" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Plugin managers should set the <code>$zsh_loaded_plugins</code> array to contain all
previously loaded plugins and the plugin currently being loaded (as the last
element). This will allow any plugin to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check which plugins are already loaded.</li>
<li>Check if it is being loaded by a plugin manager (i.e. not just sourced).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first item allows a plugin to e.g. issue a notice about missing
dependencies. Instead of issuing a notice, it may be able to satisfy the
dependencies from resources it provides. For example, <code>pure</code> prompt provides
<code>zsh-async</code> dependency library within its source tree, which is normally a
separate project. Consequently, the prompt can decide to source its private copy
of <code>zsh-async</code>, having also reliable <code>$0</code> defined by previous section (note:
<code>pure</code> doesn’t normally do this).</p>
<p>The second item allows a plugin to e.g. set up <code>$fpath</code>, knowing that plugin
manager will not handle this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">if [[ ${zsh_loaded_plugins[-1]} != */kalc &amp;&amp; -z ${fpath[(r)${0:h}]} ]]
then
    fpath+=( &quot;${0:h}&quot; )
fi
</code></pre>
<p>This will allow user to reliably source the plugin without using a plugin
manager. The code uses the wrapping braces around variables (i.e.: e.g.:
<code>${fpath…}</code>) to make it compatible with the <code>KSH_ARRAYS</code> option and the quoting
around <code>${0:h}</code> to make it compatible with the <code>SH_WORD_SPLIT</code> option.</p>

<p>Plugin managers may export the parameter <code>$ZPFX</code> which should contain a path to
a directory dedicated for user-land software, i.e. for directories <code>$ZPFX/bin</code>,
<code>$ZPFX/lib</code>, <code>$ZPFX/share</code>, etc. Suggested name of the directory is <code>polaris</code>,
Zinit uses this name and places this directory at <code>~/.zinit/polaris</code> by
default.</p>
<p>User can then configure hooks (feature of e.g. zplug and Zinit) to invoke e.g.
<code>make PREFIX=$ZPFX install</code> at clone &amp; update of the plugin to install software
like e.g. <a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras"><strong>tj/git-extras</strong></a>. This is a
developing role of Zsh plugin managers as package managers, where <code>.zshrc</code> has a
similar role to Chef or Puppet configuration and allows to <strong>declare</strong> system
state, and have the same state on different accounts / machines.</p>

<p>Zsh ships with a function <code>add-zsh-hook</code>. It has the following invocation
syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">add-zsh-hook [ -L | -dD ] [ -Uzk ] hook function
</code></pre>
<p>The command installs a <code>function</code> as one of the supported zsh <code>hook</code> entries.
which are one of: <code>chpwd</code>, <code>periodic</code>, <code>precmd</code>, <code>preexec</code>, <code>zshaddhistory</code>,
<code>zshexit</code>, <code>zsh_directory_name</code>. For their meaning refer to the
<a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Hook-Functions"><strong>Zsh
documentation</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 id="use_of_add-zle-hook-widget_to_install_zle_hooks">Use Of <code>add-zle-hook-widget</code> To Install Zle Hooks<a class="headerlink" href="#use_of_add-zle-hook-widget_to_install_zle_hooks" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Zle editor is the part of the Zsh that is responsible for receiving the text
from the user. It can be said that it’s based on widgets, which are nothing more
than Zsh functions that are allowed to be ran in Zle context, i.e. from the Zle
editor (plus a few minor differences, like e.g.: the <code>$WIDGET</code> parameter that’s
automatically set by the Zle editor).</p>
<p>The syntax of the call is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">add-zle-hook-widget [ -L | -dD ] [ -Uzk ] hook widgetname
</code></pre>
<p>The call resembles the syntax of the <code>add-zsh-hook</code> function. The only
difference is that it takes a <code>widgetname</code>, not a function name, and that the
<code>hook</code> is being one of: <code>isearch-exit</code>, <code>isearch-update</code>, <code>line-pre-redraw</code>,
<code>line-init</code>, <code>line-finish</code>, <code>history-line-set</code>, or <code>keymap-select</code>. Their
meaning is explained in the
<a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Special-Widgets"><strong>Zsh
documentation</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The use of this function is recommended because it allows to install
<strong>multiple</strong> hooks per each <code>hook</code> entry. Before introducing the
<code>add-zle-hook-widget</code> function the "normal" way to install a hook was to define
widget with the name of one of the special widgets. Now, after the function has
been introduced in Zsh <code>5.3</code> it should be used instead.</p>
<h3 id="standard_recommended_options">Standard Recommended Options<a class="headerlink" href="#standard_recommended_options" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>The following code snippet is recommended to be included at the beginning of
each of the main functions provided by the plugin:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">emulate -L zsh
setopt extended_glob warn_create_global typeset_silent \
        no_short_loops rc_quotes no_auto_pushd
</code></pre>
<p>It resets all the options to their default state according to the <code>zsh</code>
emulation mode, with use of the <code>local_options</code> option – so the options will be
restored to their previous state when leaving the function.</p>
<p>It then alters the emulation by <code>6</code> different options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>extended_glob</code> – enables one of the main Zshell features – the advanced,
  built-in regex-like globing mechanism,</li>
<li><code>warn_create_global</code> – enables warnings to be printed each time a (global)
  variable is defined without being explicitly defined by a <code>typeset</code>, <code>local</code>,
  <code>declare</code>, etc.  call; it allows to catch typos and missing localizations of
  the variables and thus prevents from writing a bad code,</li>
<li><code>typeset_silent</code> – it allows to call <code>typeset</code>, <code>local</code>, etc. multiple times on
  the same variable; without it the second call causes the variable contents to
  be printed first; using this option allows to declare variables inside loops,
  near the place of their use, which sometimes helps to write a more readable
  code,</li>
<li><code>no_short_loops</code> – disables the short-loops syntax; this is done because when
  the syntax is enabled it limits the parser's ability to detect errors (see
  this <a href="https://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2011/msg01050.html"><strong>zsh-workers post</strong></a>
  for the details),</li>
<li><code>rc_quotes</code> – adds useful ability to insert apostrophes into an
  apostrophe-quoted string, by use of <code>''</code> inside it, e.g.: <code>'a string''s
  example'</code> will yield the string <code>a string's example</code>,</li>
<li><code>no_auto_pushd</code> - disables the automatic push of the directory passed to <code>cd</code>
  builtin onto the directory stack; this is useful, because otherwise the
  internal directory changes done by the plugin will pollute the global
  directory stack.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="standard_recommended_variables">Standard Recommended Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#standard_recommended_variables" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>It's good to localize the following variables at the entry of the main function
of a plugin:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">local MATCH REPLY; integer MBEGIN MEND
local -a match mbegin mend reply
</code></pre>
<p>The variables starting with <code>m</code> and <code>M</code> are being used by the substitutions
utilizing <code>(#b)</code> and <code>(#m)</code> flags, respectively. They should not leak to the
global scope. Also, their automatic creation would trigger the warning from the
<code>warn_create_global</code> option.</p>
<p>The <code>reply</code> and <code>REPLY</code> parameters are being normally used to return an array or
a scalar from a function, respectively – it's the standard way of passing values
from functions. Their use is naturally limited to the functions called from the
main function of a plugin – they should not be used to pass data around e.g.: in
between prompts, thus it's natural to localize them in the main function.</p>
<h3 id="standard_function_name-space_prefixes">Standard Function Name-Space Prefixes<a class="headerlink" href="#standard_function_name-space_prefixes" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>The recommendation is purely subjective opinion of the author. It can evolve –
if you have any remarks, don't hesitate to

<h5 id="the_problems_solved_by_the_proposition">The Problems Solved By The Proposition<a class="headerlink" href="#the_problems_solved_by_the_proposition" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<p>However when adopted, the proposition will solve the following issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using the underscore <code>_</code> to namespace functions – this isn't the right thing
   to do because the prefix is being already used by the completion functions,
   so the namespace is already filled up greatly and the plugin functions get
   lost in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not using a prefix at all – this is also an unwanted practice as it pollutes
   the command namespace
   (<a href="https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/issues/157"><strong>an example</strong></a>
   of such issue appearing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would allow to quickly discriminate between function types – e.g.: seeing
   the <code>:</code> prefix informs the user that it's a hook-type function, while seeing
   the <code>@</code> prefix informs the user that it's an API-like function, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also provides an improvement during programming, by allowing to quickly
   limit the number of completions offered by the editor, e.g.: for Vim's
   <code>Ctrl-P</code> completing, when entering <code>+&lt;Ctrl-P&gt;</code>, then only a subset of the
   functions is being completed (see below for the type of the functions).
   <strong>Note:</strong> the editor has to be configured so that it accepts such special
   characters as part of keywords, for Vim it's: <code>:set isk+=@-@,.,+,/,:</code> for all
   of the proposed prefixes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="the_proposed_function-name_prefixes">The Proposed Function-Name Prefixes<a class="headerlink" href="#the_proposed_function-name_prefixes" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<p>The proposition of the standard prefixes is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>.</code>: for regular private functions. Example function:
   <code>.prompt_zinc_get_value</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>:</code>: for hook-like functions, so it should be used e.g.: for the
   <a href="#use_of_add-zsh-hook_to_install_hooks"><strong>Zsh hooks</strong></a> and the <a href="#use_of_add-zle-hook-widget_to_install_zle_hooks"><strong>Zle
   hooks</strong></a>, but also for any
   other
   custom hook-like mechanism in the plugin (e.g.: Zinit annexes
   <a href="http://zdharma.org/zinit/wiki/Annexes/#how_to_code_them"><strong>use</strong></a> such
   prefix for the Zinit hook functions). Example function name:
   <code>:prompt_zinc_precmd</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>+</code>: for output functions, i.e.: for functions that print to the standard
   output and error or to a log, etc. Example function name:
   <code>+prompt_zinc_output_segment</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/</code>: for debug functions, i.e: for functions that output debug messages to
   the screen or to a log or e.g.: gather some debug data. <strong>Note:</strong> the slash
   makes it impossible for such functions to be auto-loaded via the <code>autoload</code>
   mechanism. It is somewhat risky to assume, that this will never be needed for
   the functions, however the limited number of available ASCII characters
   justifies such allocation. Example function name: <code>/prompt_zinc_dmsg</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@</code>: for API-like functions, i.e: for functions that are on a boundary to a
   subsystem and expose its functionality through a well-defined, in general
   fixed interface. For example this plugin standard
   <a href="#4_zsh-plugin-run-on-update_call"><strong>defines</strong></a> the function <code>@zsh-plugin-run-on-update</code>,
   which is exposing a plugin manager's functionality in a well-defined way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="example_code_utilizing_the_prefixes">Example Code Utilizing The Prefixes<a class="headerlink" href="#example_code_utilizing_the_prefixes" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<pre><code class="language-shell">.zinc_register_hooks() {
    add-zsh-hook precmd :zinc_precmd
    /zinc_dmsg &quot;Installed precmd hook with result: $?&quot;
    @zsh-plugin-run-on-unload &quot;add-zsh-hook -d precmd :zinc_precmd&quot;
    +zinc_print &quot;Zinc initialization complete&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="preventing_function_pollution">Preventing Function Pollution<a class="headerlink" href="#preventing_function_pollution" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>When writing a larger autoload function, it very often is the case that the
function contains definitions of other functions. When the main function
finishes executing, the functions are being left defined. This might be
undesired, e.g.: because of the command name-space pollution. The following
snippet of code, when added at the beginning of the main function will
automatically unset the sub-functions when leaving the main function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell"># Don't leak any functions
typeset -g prjef
prjef=( ${(k)functions} )
trap &quot;unset -f -- \&quot;\${(k)functions[@]:|prjef}\&quot; &amp;&gt;/dev/null; unset prjef&quot; EXIT
trap &quot;unset -f -- \&quot;\${(k)functions[@]:|prjef}\&quot; &amp;&gt;/dev/null; unset prjef; return 1&quot; INT
</code></pre>
<p>Replace the <code>prj*</code> prefix with your project name, e.g.: <code>rustef</code> for a
<code>rust</code>-related plugin. The <code>*ef</code> stands for "entry functions". The snippet works
as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The line <code>prjef=( ${(k)functions} )</code> remembers all the functions that are
   currently defined – which means that the list excludes the functions that are
   to be yet defined by the body of the main function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code <code>unset -f -- "${(k)functions[@]:|prjef}"</code> first does an subtraction
   of array contents – the <code>:|</code> substitution operator – of the functions that
   are defined at the moment of leaving of the function (the <code>trap</code>-s invoke the
   code in this moment) with the list of functions from the start of the main
   function – the ones stored in the variables <code>$prjef</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It then unsets the resulting list of the functions – being only the newly
   defined functions in the main function – by passing it to <code>unset -f …</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This way the functions defined by the body of the main (most often an autoload)
function will be only set during the execution of the function.</p>
<h3 id="preventing_parameter_pollution">Preventing Parameter Pollution<a class="headerlink" href="#preventing_parameter_pollution" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>When writing a plugin one often needs to keep a state during the Zsh
session. To do this it is natural to use global parameters. However,
when the number of the parameters grows one might want to limit it.</p>
<p>With the following method, only a single global parameter per plugin can be
sufficient:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">typeset -A PLGMAP
typeset -A some_map
typeset -a some_array

# Use
PLGMAP[state]=1
some_map[state]=1
some_array[1]=state
</code></pre>
<p>can be converted into:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">typeset -A PLGMAP

# Use
PLGMAP[state]=1
PLGMAP[some_map__state]=1
PLGMAP[some_array__1]=state
</code></pre>
<p>The use of this method is very unproblematic. The author reduced the number of
global parameters in one of projects by 21 by using an automatic conversion with
Vim substitution patterns with back references without any problems.</p>
