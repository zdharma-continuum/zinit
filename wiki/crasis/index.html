<p>Zsh exposes its parser via <code>(z)</code> substitution flag. Parsing <code>.zshrc</code> is totally
possible. This way <code>Crasis</code> lets you edit your <code>Zinit</code> commands located in
<code>.zshrc</code>. All in pure <code>Zshell</code> code.</p>
<p>No more commenting-out a line with a text editor to disable plugin, cluttering
<code>.zshrc</code>, now you can just <strong>press a button</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/147225"><img alt="asciicast" src="https://asciinema.org/a/147225.png" /></a></p>
<p><code>Crasis</code> uses pure-Zshell <a href="http://github.com/zdharma/zui/"><strong>ZUI</strong></a> library to
create <code>ncurses</code> interface.</p>
<h2 id="installation_basic_use">Installation &amp; Basic Use<a class="headerlink" href="#installation_basic_use" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Install <a href="https://github.com/zdharma/zinit"><strong>Zinit</strong></a> and add following
commands to <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="SystemVerilog">zinit light zdharma/zui
zinit light zdharma/zplugin-crasis
</code></pre>

<p>To use, invoke <code>crasis [optional zshrc path]</code> or press <code>Ctrl-o-k</code>. Global
variables <code>CRASIS_THEME</code> and <code>CRASIS_LAYOUT</code> can be used to override
configuration file <code>crasis.conf</code> (located in plugin's tree), i.e.:</p>
<pre><code class="SystemVerilog">CRASIS_THEME=&quot;zdharma-256&quot; CRASIS_LAYOUT=&quot;contract&quot; crasis
</code></pre>

<p><code>256</code>-color themes require Zsh <code>5.3</code> or later.</p>
