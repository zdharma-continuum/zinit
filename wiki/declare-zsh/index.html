<p><a href="https://github.com/zdharma/declare-zsh"><strong>declare-zsh</strong></a> is a parser for
<code>zinit</code> commands in <code>.zshrc</code>. It allows to perform the following actions on
<code>.zshrc</code> <strong>from the command-line</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable and disable selected plugins and snippets,</li>
<li>add plugins and snippets,</li>
<li>delete plugins and snippets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>In other words, by issuing a <code>declzsh</code> command the user deploys a task of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reading and parsing of the <code>~/.zshrc</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making changes (like removal of a plugin, i.e. of <code>zinit load
   {removed-plugin}</code> command together with the possible associated <code>zinit ice
   …</code> command) and then…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing the result back to the <code>zshrc</code> (by default, the result is stored to
   <code>~/.zshrc_gen</code> file for safety, but the author wants to emhasize very
   strongly, that <strong>breaking something within the parsed <code>zshrc</code> is nearly
   impossible</strong> and the tool can be safely used with option <code>-o ~/.zshrc</code> which
   points <code>declzsh</code> to the original <code>zshrc</code> as the destination, output file).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="examples_screenshots">Examples &amp; Screenshots<a class="headerlink" href="#examples_screenshots" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Example <strong>disabling</strong> of a plugin via the <strong>toggle</strong> option <strong>-TT</strong> – this
   works because the commands preceded by <code>:</code> are ignored by the shell:
<img alt="screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/declare-zsh/master/img/toggle.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example <strong>addition</strong> of a plugin via the option <strong>-AA</strong> – in order to also
   set up ice modifiers enclose them in a preceding square-bracket block, i.e.
   <code>declzsh -AA '[ wait"1" lucid ] zdharma/null'</code>:
<img alt="screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/declare-zsh/master/img/add.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example <strong>deletion</strong> of a plugin via the <strong>purge</strong> option <strong>-PP</strong> – the
   argument is treated as pattern, pass <code>*</code> to delete all plugins and snippets!:
<img alt="screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/declare-zsh/master/img/purge.png" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="usage">Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#usage" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Multiple actions, i.e. multiple options like <code>-AA</code>, <code>-PP</code>, <code>-DD</code>, etc. are
possible in a single <code>declzsh</code> run.</p>
