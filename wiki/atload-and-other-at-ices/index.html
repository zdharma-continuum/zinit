<h1 id="the_atload_ice_and_other_at_ices">The <code>atload</code> Ice (and other <code>at…</code> ices)<a class="headerlink" href="#the_atload_ice_and_other_at_ices" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>There are four code-receiving ices: <code>atclone</code>, <code>atpull</code>, <code>atinit</code>, <code>atload</code>.
Their role is to <strong>receive a portion of Zsh code and execute it in certain
moments of the plugin life-cycle</strong>. The <strong><code>atclone</code></strong> executes it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>after cloning</strong> the associated plugin or snippet to the disk.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong><code>atpull</code></strong> is similar, but works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>after updating</strong> the associated plugin or snippet. </li>
</ul>
<p>Next, <strong><code>atinit</code></strong> works similar, but is being activated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>before loading</strong> of the associated plugin or snippet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last, <strong><code>atload</code></strong> is being activated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>after loading</strong> of the associated plugin or snippet.</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience, you can use each of the ices multiple times in single <code>zinit
ice …</code> invocation – all the passed commands will be executed in the given order.</p>
<p>The <code>atpull</code> ice recognizes a special value: <code>%atclone</code> (so the code looks i.e.:
<code>atpull'%atclone'</code>). It causes the contents of the <code>atclone</code> ice to be copied
into the contents of the <code>atpull</code> ice. This is handy when the same tasks have to
be performed on clone <strong>and</strong> on update of plugin or snippet, like e.g.: in the
<a href="../Direnv-explanation"><strong>Direnv example</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="exclamation_mark-preceded_atload"><em>Exclamation mark</em>-preceded <code>atload</code><a class="headerlink" href="#exclamation_mark-preceded_atload" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The <code>wrap-track</code> ice allows to track and unload plugins that defer their
initialization into a function run later after sourcing the plugin's script –
when the function is called, the plugin is then being fully initialized.
However, if the function is being called from the <code>atload</code> ice, then there is a
simpler method than the <code>wrap-track</code> ice – an <em>exclamation mark</em>-preceded
<code>atload</code> contents. The exclamation mark causes the effects of the execution of
the code passed to <code>atload</code> ice to be recorded.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example<a class="headerlink" href="#example" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>For example, in the following invocation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit ice id-as'test' atload'!PATH+=:~/share'
zinit load zdharma-continuum/null
</code></pre>
<p>the <code>$PATH</code> is being changed within <code>atload</code> ice. Zinit's tracking records
<code>$PATH</code> changes and withdraws them on plugin unload, and also shows information
loading:</p>
<pre><code>$ zplg report test
Report for test plugin
<span class="hljs-blue">----------------------</span>
Source  (reporting enabled)

<span class="hljs-orange">PATH elements added:</span>
/home/sg/share
</code></pre>

<p>As it can be seen, the <code>atload</code> code is being correctly tracked and can be
unloaded &amp; viewed. Below is the result of using the <code>unload</code> subcommand to
unload the <code>test</code> plugin:</p>
<pre><code>$ zinit unload test
<span class="hljs-blue">--- Unloading plugin: test ---</span>
Removing PATH element /home/sg/share
Unregistering plugin test
Plugin report saved to $LASTREPORT
</code></pre>

<h2 id="practical_example">Practical example<a class="headerlink" href="#practical_example" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The same example as in the <a href="../wrap-track/"><strong>Tracking precmd-based Plugins</strong></a>
article, but using the <em>exclamation mark</em>-preceded <code>atload</code> instead of
<code>wrap-track</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh"># Load when MYPROMPT == 4
zinit ice load'![[ $MYPROMPT = 4 ]]' unload'![[ $MYPROMPT != 4 ]]' \
            atload'!source ~/.p10k.zsh; _p9k_precmd'
zinit load romkatv/powerlevel10k
</code></pre>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The creation of the four additional Zle-widgets will be recorded (see the
<a href="../wrap-track"><strong>article</strong></a> on <code>wrap-track</code> for more information) – the effect will
be exactly the same as with the <code>wrap-track</code> ice.  The widgets will be properly
deleted/restored on the plugin unload with <code>MYPROMPT=3</code> (for example) and the
shell state will be clean, ready to load a new prompt.</p>
