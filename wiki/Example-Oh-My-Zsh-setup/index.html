    Hack: check whether the content contains a h1 headline. If it does, the
    top-level anchor must be skipped, since it would be redundant to the link
    to the current page that is located just above the anchor. Therefore we
    directly continue with the children of the anchor.

<p><strong>A</strong> - Most themes use this option.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - OMZ themes use this library and some other use also the plugin. It
provides many aliases – <code>atload''</code> shows how to disable some of them (e.g.: to
use program <code>rgburke/grv</code>).</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Set OMZ theme. Loaded separately because the theme needs the <code>!</code> passed
        to the <code>wait</code> ice to reset the prompt after loading the snippet in Turbo.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Some plugins: a) syntax-highlighting, loaded possibly early for a
        better user experience), b) example functional plugin, c) Docker
        completion.</p>
<p>Above setup loads everything after prompt, because of preceding <code>wait</code> ice. That
is called <strong>Turbo mode</strong>, it shortens Zsh startup time by <u>50%-80%</u>, so
e.g. instead of 200 ms, it'll be getting your shell started up after <strong>40 ms</strong>
(!).</p>
<p>It is using the for-syntax, which is a recent addition to Zinit and it's
described in detail <a href="https://zdharma.org/zinit/wiki/For-Syntax/">on this page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="without_using_turbo_and_for-syntax">Without using Turbo and for-syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#without_using_turbo_and_for-syntax" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The same setup using the classic syntax and without Turbo mode (prompt will be
initially set like in typical, normal setup – <strong>you can remove <code>wait</code> only from
the theme plugin</strong> and its dependencies to have the same effect while still
using Turbo for everything remaining):</p>
<pre><code class="zsh"># A.
setopt promptsubst

# B.
zinit snippet OMZL::git.zsh

# C.
zinit ice atload&quot;unalias grv&quot;
zinit snippet OMZP::git

# D.

<p>In general, Turbo can be optionally enabled only for a subset of plugins or for
all plugins. It needs Zsh >= 5.3.</p>
