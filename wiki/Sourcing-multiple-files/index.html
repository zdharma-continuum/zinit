                  <h1>Sourcing Multiple Files</h1>
                
                <p>Normally <code>src''</code> can be used to specify additional file to source:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit ice pick&quot;powerless.zsh&quot; src&quot;utilities.zsh&quot;
zinit light martinrotter/powerless
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>pick''</code> – provide main file to source (can be a pattern like <code>*.sh</code> –
  alphabetically first matched file is sourced),</li>
<li><code>src''</code> – provide second file to source (not a pattern, plain file name)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>However, via <code>atload''</code> ice one can provide simple loop to source more files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit ice svn pick&quot;completion.zsh&quot; \
    atload'local f; for f in git.zsh misc.zsh; do \
        source $f \
    done'
zinit snippet OMZ::lib
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>svn</code> – use Subversion to clone <code>OMZ::lib</code> (the whole Oh My Zsh <code>lib/</code>
  directory),</li>
<li>note that <code>atload''</code> uses apostrophes not double quotes, to literally put <code>$f</code>
  into the string,</li>
<li><code>atload</code>'s code is automatically being run <strong>within the snippet's (or
  plugin's) directory</strong>,</li>
<li><code>atload''</code> code isn't tracked by Zinit, i.e. cannot be unloaded, unless you
  load a plugin (not a snippet) with <code>zinit load …</code> and prepend the value of
  the ice with exclamation mark, i.e.  <code>atload'!local f; for …'</code>,</li>
<li><code>atload''</code> is executed after loading main files (<code>pick''</code> and <code>src''</code> ones).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The <code>multisrc''</code> ice, which loads <strong>multiple</strong> files enumerated with
spaces as the separator (e.g. <code>multisrc'misc.zsh grep.zsh'</code>) and also using
brace-expansion syntax (e.g. <code>multisrc'{misc,grep}.zsh')</code>. Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit ice svn pick&quot;completion.zsh&quot; multisrc'git.zsh \
    functions.zsh {history,grep}.zsh'
zinit snippet OMZ::lib
</code></pre>
<p>The all possible ways to use the <code>multisrc''</code> ice-mod:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit ice depth&quot;1&quot; multisrc=&quot;lib/{functions,misc}.zsh&quot; pick&quot;/dev/null&quot;
zinit load robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

# Can use patterns
zinit ice svn multisrc&quot;{funct*,misc}.zsh&quot; pick&quot;/dev/null&quot;
zinit snippet OMZ::lib

array=( {functions,misc}.zsh )
zinit ice svn multisrc&quot;$array&quot; pick&quot;/dev/null&quot;
zinit snippet OMZ::lib

# Will use the array's value at the moment of plugin load
# – this can matter in case of using Turbo mode
array=( {functions,misc}.zsh )
zinit ice svn multisrc&quot;\$array&quot; pick&quot;/dev/null&quot;
zinit snippet OMZ::lib

# Compatible with KSH_ARRAYS option
array=( {functions,misc}.zsh )
zinit ice svn multisrc&quot;${array[*]}&quot; pick&quot;/dev/null&quot;
zinit snippet OMZ::lib

# Compatible with KSH_ARRAYS option
array=( {functions,misc}.zsh )
zinit ice svn multisrc&quot;\${array[*]}&quot; pick&quot;/dev/null&quot;
zinit snippet OMZ::lib

zinit ice svn multisrc&quot;misc.zsh functions.zsh&quot; pick&quot;/dev/null&quot;
zinit snippet OMZ::lib

# Also – hack Zinit: the ice's contents is simply `eval'-uated
# like follows: eval &quot;reply=($multisrc)&quot;. So it might get handy on
# an occasion to pass code there, but first you must close the paren
# and then don't forget to assign `reply', and to provide a trailing
# opening paren. In the code be careful to not redefine any variable
# used internally by Zinit – e.g.: `i' is safe:

array=( {functions,misc}.zsh )
zinit ice svn multisrc'); local i; for i in $array; do \
            reply+=( ${i/.zsh/.sh} ); \
        done; ((1)' pick&quot;/dev/null&quot;
zinit snippet OMZ::lib
</code></pre>
<p>--</p>
<h2 id="changes_in_the_recent_zinit">Changes In The Recent Zinit<a class="headerlink" href="#changes_in_the_recent_zinit" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Recently, Zinit has been extended with the <a href="../For-Syntax/">For-Syntax</a> which
can in some situations replace a typical <code>multisrc''</code> loading. The point is that
this syntax allows to easily specify snippets to source – and do this within a
single Zinit command. Thus, instead of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">zinit ice multisrc'(functions|misc|completion).zsh'
zinit snippet OMZ::lib
</code></pre>
<p>it's possible to write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">zinit for \
    OMZL::functions.zsh \
    OMZL::misc.zsh \                                                                    
    OMZL::completion.zsh
</code></pre>
<p>which is somewhat easier on eyes. Also – an <strong>important</strong> property: the multiple
snippets loaded with the for-syntax are being loaded <em>separately</em>, which means
that they will not cause a longer keyboard blockage, which could have been
noticeable – when using Turbo. The Zinit scheduler will distribute the work over
time and will allow activation of keyboard in between the snippets. The
<code>multisrc''</code> way doesn't work this way – sourcing many files can cause
noticeable keyboard freezes (in Turbo).</p>
