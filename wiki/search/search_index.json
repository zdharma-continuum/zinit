A Few Remarks # The syntax automatically detects if the object is a snippet or a plugin, by checking if the object is an URL, i.e.: if it starts with http*:// or OMZ:: , etc. To load a local-file snippet (which will be treaten as a local-directory plugin by default) use the is-snippet ice, To load a plugin in light mode use the light-mode ice. If the plugin name collides with an ice name, precede the plugin name with @ , e.g.: @sharkdp/fd (collides with the sh ice, Zinit will take the plugin name as sh\"arkdp/fd\" ), see the next section for an example.

Basic Plugin Loading # zinit load zdharma/history-search-multi-word zinit light zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting Above commands show two ways of basic plugin loading. load causes reporting to be enabled \u2013 you can track what plugin does, view the information with zinit report {plugin-spec} and then also unload the plugin with zinit unload {plugin-spec} . light is a significantly faster loading without tracking and reporting, by using which user resigns of the ability to view the plugin report and to unload it. Note In Turbo mode the slowdown caused by tracking is negligible. Oh My Zsh, Prezto # To load Oh My Zsh and Prezto plugins, use snippet feature. Snippets are single files downloaded by curl , wget , etc. (an automatic detection of the download tool is being performed) directly from URL. For example: zinit snippet 'https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh' zinit snippet 'https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/blob/master/modules/helper/init.zsh' Also, for Oh My Zsh and Prezto, you can use OMZ:: and PZT:: shorthands: zinit snippet OMZ::plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh zinit snippet PZT::modules/helper/init.zsh Moreover, snippets support Subversion protocol, supported also by Github. This allows to load snippets that are multi-file (for example a Prezto module can consist of two or more files, e.g. init.zsh and alias.zsh ). Default files that will be sourced are: *.plugin.zsh , init.zsh , *.zsh-theme : # URL points to directory zinit ice svn zinit snippet PZT::modules/docker Snippets and Performance # Using curl , wget , etc. along with Subversion allows to almost completely avoid code dedicated to Oh My Zsh and Prezto, and also to other frameworks. This gives profits in performance of Zinit , it is really fast and also compact (causing low memory footprint and short loading time). Some Ice-Modifiers # The command zinit ice provides Ice-modifiers for single next command (see the README subsection ice-modifiers ). The logic is that \"ice\" is something something that\u2019s added (e.g. to a drink or a coffee) \u2013 and in the Zinit sense this means that ice is a modifier added to the next Zinit command, and also something that melts (so it doesn\u2019t last long) \u2013 and in the Zinit use it means that the modifier lasts for only single next Zinit command. Using one other Ice-modifier \" pick \" user can explicitly select the file to source : zinit ice svn pick\"init.zsh\" zinit snippet PZT::modules/git Content of Ice-modifier is simply put into \"\u2026\" , '\u2026' , or $'\u2026' . No need for \":\" after Ice-mod name (although it's allowed, so as the equal sign = , so e.g. pick=\"init.zsh\" or pick=init.zsh are being correctly recognized) . This way editors like vim and emacs and also zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting and zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting will highlight contents of Ice-modifiers. as\"program\" # A plugin might not be a file for sourcing, but a command to be added to $PATH . To obtain this effect, use Ice-modifier as with value program (or an alias value command ). zinit ice as\"program\" cp\"httpstat.sh -> httpstat\" pick\"httpstat\" zinit light b4b4r07/httpstat Above command will add plugin directory to $PATH , copy file httpstat.sh into httpstat and add execution rights ( +x ) to the file selected with pick , i.e. to httpstat . Other Ice-mod exists, mv , which works like cp but moves a file instead of copying it. mv is ran before cp . Note The cp and mv ices (and also as some other ones, like atclone ) are being run when the plugin or snippet is being installed . To test them again first delete the plugin or snippet by zinit delete PZT::modules/osx (for example). atpull\"\u2026\" # Copying file is safe for doing later updates \u2013 original files of repository are unmodified and Git will report no conflicts. However, mv also can be used, if a proper atpull (an Ice\u2013modifier ran at update of plugin) will be used: zinit ice as\"program\" mv\"httpstat.sh -> httpstat\" \\ pick\"httpstat\" atpull'!git reset --hard' zinit light b4b4r07/httpstat If atpull starts with exclamation mark, then it will be run before git pull , and before mv . Nevertheless, atpull , mv , cp are ran only if new commits are to be fetched . So in summary, when user runs zinit update b4b4r07/httpstat to update this plugin, and there are new commits, what happens first is that git reset --hard is ran \u2013 and it restores original httpstat.sh , then git pull is ran and it downloads new commits (doing fast-forward), then mv is ran again so that the command is httpstat not httpstat.sh . This way the mv ice can be used to induce a permanent changes into the plugin's contents without blocking the ability to update it with git (or with subversion in case of snippets, more on this below at ** ). Note For exclamation mark to not be expanded by Zsh in interactive session, use '\u2026' not \"\u2026\" to enclose contents of atpull Ice-mod. Snippets-Commands # Commands can also be added to $PATH using snippets . For example: zinit ice mv\"httpstat.sh -> httpstat\" \\ pick\"httpstat\" as\"program\" zinit snippet \\ https://github.com/b4b4r07/httpstat/blob/master/httpstat.sh ( ** ) Snippets also support atpull Ice-mod, so it\u2019s possible to do e.g. atpull'!svn revert' . There\u2019s also atinit Ice-mod, executed before each loading of plugin or snippet. Snippets-Completions # By using the as'' ice-mod with value completion you can point the snippet subcommand directly to a completion file, e.g.: zinit ice as\"completion\" zinit snippet https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/master/contrib/completion/zsh/_docker Completion Management # Zinit allows to disable and enable each completion in every plugin. Try installing a popular plugin that provides completions: zinit ice blockf zinit light zsh-users/zsh-completions First command (the blockf ice) will block the traditional method of adding completions. Zinit uses own method (based on symlinks instead of adding a number of directories to $fpath ). Zinit will automatically install completions of a newly downloaded plugin. To uninstall the completions and install them again, you would use: zinit cuninstall zsh-users/zsh-completions # uninstall zinit creinstall zsh-users/zsh-completions # install Listing Completions # Note zplg is an alias that can be used in interactive sessions. To see what completions all plugins provide, in tabular formatting and with name of each plugin, use: zplg clist This command is specially adapted for plugins like zsh-users/zsh-completions , which provide many completions \u2013 listing will have 3 completions per line (so that a smaller number of terminal pages will be occupied) like this: ... atach, bitcoin-cli, bower zsh-users/zsh-completions bundle, caffeinate, cap zsh-users/zsh-completions cask, cf, chattr zsh-users/zsh-completions ... You can show more completions per line by providing an argument to clist , e.g. zplg clist 6 , will show: ... bundle, caffeinate, cap, cask, cf, chattr zsh-users/zsh-completions cheat, choc, cmake, coffee, column, composer zsh-users/zsh-completions console, dad, debuild, dget, dhcpcd, diana zsh-users/zsh-completions ... Enabling and Disabling Completions # Completions can be disabled, so that e.g. original Zsh completion will be used.

There\u2019s one more command, zinit csearch , that will search all plugin directories for available completions, and show if they are installed: This sums up to complete control over completions. Subversion for Subdirectories # In general, to use subdirectories of Github projects as snippets add /trunk/{path-to-dir} to URL, for example: zinit ice svn zinit snippet https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/trunk/src # For Oh My Zsh and Prezto, the OMZ:: and PZT:: prefixes work # without the need to add the `/trunk/` infix (however the path # should point to a directory, not to a file): zinit ice svn; zinit snippet PZT::modules/docker Snippets too have completions installed by default, like plugins. Turbo Mode (Zsh >= 5.3) # The Ice-mod wait allows you to postpone loading of a plugin to the moment when processing of .zshrc is finished and prompt is being shown. It is like Windows \u2013 during startup, it shows desktop even though it still loads data in background. This has drawbacks, but is for sure better than blank screen for 10 minutes. And here, in Zinit, there are no drawbacks of this approach \u2013 no lags, freezes, etc. \u2013 the command line is fully usable while the plugins are being loaded, for number of such plugins like 10 or 20 . Note Turbo mode will speed up Zsh startup by 50%\u201373% . For example instead of 200 ms, it'll be 50 ms (!) Zsh 5.3 or greater is required. To use this Turbo mode add wait ice to the target plugin in one of following ways: PS1=\"READY > \" zinit ice wait'!0' zinit load halfo/lambda-mod-zsh-theme This sets plugin psprint/zprompts to be loaded 0 seconds after zshrc .

It is also sufficient to provide just the word wait , it\u2019ll work like wait'0' (and wait'!' like wait'!0' ). The exclamation mark causes Zinit to reset-prompt after loading plugin, so it is needed for themes. The same with Prezto prompts, with a longer delay: zplg ice svn silent wait'!1' atload'prompt smiley' zplg snippet PZT::modules/prompt Using zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions without any drawbacks: zinit ice wait lucid atload'_zsh_autosuggest_start' zinit light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions Explanation: Autosuggestions uses precmd hook, which is being called right after processing zshrc (right before the first prompt). Turbo mode will wait 1 second after that, so precmd will not be installed and thus not called at that first prompt. This makes autosuggestions inactive at the first prompt. However the given atload Ice-mod fixes this, it calls the same function that precmd would, right after loading autosuggestions, resulting in exactly the same behavior of the plugin. The ice lucid causes the under-prompt message saying Loaded zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions that normally appears for every Turbo-loaded plugin to not show. Turbo-Loading Sophisticated Prompts # For some, mostly advanced themes the initialization of the prompt is being done in a precmd -hook, i.e.; in a function that's gets called before each prompt. The hook is installed by the add-zsh-hook Zsh function by adding its name to the $precmd_functions array. To make the prompt fully initialized after Turbo loading in the middle of the prompt (the same situation as with the zsh-autosuggestions plugin), the hook should be called from atload'' ice. First, find the name of the hook function by examining the $precmd_functions array. For example, for robobenklein/zinc theme, they'll be two functions: prompt_zinc_setup and prompt_zinc_precmd : root@sg > ~ > print $precmd_functions < \u2714 < 22:21:33 _zsh_autosuggest_start prompt_zinc_setup prompt_zinc_precmd Then, add them to the ice-list in the atload'' ice: zinit ice wait'!' lucid nocd \\ atload'!prompt_zinc_setup; prompt_zinc_precmd' zinit load robobenklein/zinc The exclamation mark in atload'!\u2026' is to track the functions allowing the plugin to be unloaded, as described here . It might be useful for the multi-prompt setup described next. Automatic Load/Unload on Condition # Ices load and unload allow to define when you want plugins active or unactive.

This technique can be used to have plugin-sets, e.g. by defining parameter $PLUGINS with possible values like cpp , web , admin and by setting load / unload conditions to activate different plugins on cpp , on web , etc. Note The difference with wait is that load / unload are constantly active, not only till first activation. Note that for unloading of a plugin to work the plugin needs to be loaded with tracking (so zinit load \u2026 , not zinit light \u2026 ). Tracking causes slight slowdown, however this doesn\u2019t influence Zsh startup time when using Turbo mode. See also Wiki on multiple prompts .

So basically what this means is that you can install plugins normally, like before, however with use of a metadata stored in the NPM package registry. This way you don't have to (but still can) specify ices, which might be handy when the ice-mod list is long and complex. Motivation # The motivation for adding such functionality was: Zplugin is a very flexible plugin manager however users often feel overwhelmed by its configuration. It has many package-manager -like features, such as: it can run Makefiles , automatically provide shims (i.e.: forwarder scripts) for the binaries, extend $PATH to expose the binaries, and more. In general, Zplugin has many hooks which allow surprising and beautiful things, however their content often evolves to a gradually better and better one and it's hard to keep track of the current version of them. So a solution came up : why not publish a package at the NPM-registry with the plugin configurations (i.e.: ice-mods) stored in the package.json file? Introductory Example # This way, instead of the following command used to install fzf : zplugin lucid as=program pick=\"$ZPFX/bin/(fzf|fzf-tmux)\" \\ atclone=\"cp shell/completion.zsh _fzf_completion; \\ cp bin/(fzf|fzf-tmux) $ZPFX/bin\" \\ make=\"PREFIX=$ZPFX install\" for \\ junegunn/fzf you only need: zplugin pack for fzf to get the complete setup of the fuzzy finder, including: the completion, the additional executable-script fzf-tmux . The installation is real, package-manager -like, because you don't need to invoke Zplugin anymore once installed to use fzf (that's because fzf is just a binary program and not e.g.: a shell function). You can also update the package with zplugin update fzf \u2013 it'll cause the project to refresh and rebuild, like with a \"normal\" package manager such as apt-get . However, it'll actually be more like to emerge from Gentoo, because the installation will be from the source\u2026 unless\u2026 you'll pick a binary installation :) So Zplugin is like apt-get and emerge in one! Pros Of Using Zplugin NPM-Support For Regular Software Installations # Using Zplugin to install software where one could use a regular package manager has several advantages: Pro: The Zplugin NPM packages typically use the URLs to the official and latest distributions of the software (like e.g.: the ecs-cli package, which uses the URL: https://amazon-ecs-cli.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-cli-linux-amd64-latest when installing on Linux). Pro: You can influence the installation easily by specifying Zplugin ice-mods, e.g.: zplugin pack=bgn atclone=\"cp fzy.1 $ZPFX/man/man1\" for fzy to install also the man page for the fzy fuzzy finder (this omission in the package will be fixed soon). Pro: The installation is much more flexible than a normal package manager. Example available degrees of freedom: to install from Git or from release-tarball, or from binary-release file, to install via shims or via extending $PATH , or by copying to $ZPFX/bin , to download files and apply patches to the source by using the Patch-Dl annex features. Pro: The installations are located in the user home directory, which doesn't require root access. Also, for Gems and Node modules, they are installed in their plugin directory, which can have advantages (e.g.: isolation allowing e.g: easy removal by rm -rf \u2026 ). Con: You're somewhat \"on your own\", with no support from any package maintainer. Thus, summing up 1. with 4., it might be nice/convenient to, for example, have the latest ECS CLI binary installed in the home directory, without using root access and always the latest, and \u2013 summing up with 2. and 3. \u2013 to, for example, have always the latest README downloaded by an additional ice: dl'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli/master/README.md' (and then to have the README converted into a man page by the remark Markdown processor or other via an atclone'' ice, as the tool doesn't have any official man page). The Zsh-Packages Organization # The home for the packages is Zsh-Packages GitHub organization. You can find the available packages there, which as of 2019-12-11 include: asciidoctor \u2013 the AsciiDoc converter, installed as a Gem locally in the plugin directory with use of the Bin-Gem-Node annex, doctoc \u2013 the TOC (table of contents) generator for Markdown documents, installed as a Node package locally in the plugin directory with use of the Bin-Gem-Node annex, ecs-cli \u2013 the Amazon ECS command line tool, downloaded directly from the URL (or from the URL for OS X \u2013 automatically selected), firefox-dev \u2013 Firefox Developer Edition, downloaded from the URL (or from the URL for OS X; the OS X installation only downloads the dmg image, so it is'nt yet complete), fzf \u2013 the fuzzy-finder, installed from source (from a tarball or Git) or from the GitHub-releases binary, ls_colors \u2013 the trapd00r/LS_COLORS color definitions for GNU ls , ogham/exa and Zshell's completion. Adding Your Own Package # You can contact me to have the repository at the Zsh-Packages organization. Then, you'll only need to: Create an NPM account Invoke npm login .

So a solution came up : why not publish a package at GitHub with the plugin configurations (i.e.: ice-mods) stored in an NPM package-resembling package.json file? Introductory Example # This way, instead of the following command used to install fzf : zinit lucid as=program pick=\"$ZPFX/bin/(fzf|fzf-tmux)\" \\ atclone=\"cp shell/completion.zsh _fzf_completion; \\ cp bin/(fzf|fzf-tmux) $ZPFX/bin\" \\ make=\"PREFIX=$ZPFX install\" for \\ junegunn/fzf you only need: zinit pack for fzf to get the complete setup of the fuzzy finder, including: the completion, the additional executable-script fzf-tmux . The installation is real, package-manager -like, because you don't need to invoke Zinit anymore once installed to use fzf (that's because fzf is just a binary program and not e.g.: a shell function). You can also update the package with zinit update fzf \u2013 it'll cause the project to refresh and rebuild, like with a \"normal\" package manager such as apt-get . However, it'll actually be more like to emerge from Gentoo, because the installation will be from the source\u2026 unless\u2026 you'll pick a binary installation :) So Zinit is like apt-get and emerge in one! Pros Of Using Zinit Package For Regular Software Installations # Using Zinit to install software where one could use a regular package manager has several advantages: Pro: The Zinit packages typically use the URLs to the official and latest distributions of the software (like e.g.: the ecs-cli package, which uses the URL: https://amazon-ecs-cli.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-cli-linux-amd64-latest when installing on Linux). Pro: You can influence the installation easily by specifying Zinit ice-mods, e.g.: zinit pack=bgn atclone=\"cp fzy.1 $ZPFX/man/man1\" for fzy to install also the man page for the fzy fuzzy finder (this omission in the package will be fixed soon). Pro: The installation is much more flexible than a normal package manager. Example available degrees of freedom: to install from Git or from release-tarball, or from binary-release file, to install via shims or via extending $PATH , or by copying to $ZPFX/bin , to download files and apply patches to the source by using the Patch-Dl annex features. Pro: The installations are located in the user home directory, which doesn't require root access. Also, for Gems and Node modules, they are installed in their plugin directory, which can have advantages (e.g.: isolation allowing e.g: easy removal by rm -rf \u2026 ). Con: You're somewhat \"on your own\", with no support from any package maintainer. Thus, summing up 1. with 4., it might be nice/convenient to, for example, have the latest ECS CLI binary installed in the home directory, without using root access and always the latest, and \u2013 summing up with 2. and 3. \u2013 to, for example, have always the latest README downloaded by an additional ice: dl'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli/master/README.md' (and then to have the README converted into a man page by the remark Markdown processor or other via an atclone'' ice, as the tool doesn't have any official man page).

Source scripts through an automatically created function with the above $GEM_HOME , $NODE_PATH and cd features available, Create the so called shims known from rbenv \u2013 the same feature as the first item of this enumaration \u2013 of running a program without adding anything to $PATH with all of the above features, however through an automatic script created in $ZPFX/bin , not a function (the first item uses a function-based mechanism), Automatic updates of Ruby gems and Node modules during regular plugin and snippet updates with zinit update \u2026 . Installation # Simply load like a regular plugin, i.e.: zinit light zinit-zsh/z-a-bin-gem-node After executing this command you can then use the dl'' and patch'' ice-mods. How it works \u2013 bird's-eye view # Below is a diagram explaining the major feature \u2013 exposing a binary program or script through a Zsh function of the same name: This way there is no need to add anything to $PATH \u2013 z-a-bin-gem-node will automatically create a function that will wrap the binary and provide it on the command line like if it was being placed in the $PATH . Also, like mentioned in the enumeration, the function can automatically export $GEM_HOME , $NODE_PATH shell variables and also automatically cd into the plugin or snippet directory right before executing the binary and then cd back to the original directory after the execution is finished. Also, like already mentioned, instead of the function an automatically created script \u2013 so called shim \u2013 can be used for the same purpose and with the same functionality. How it works, in detail # Suppose that you would want to install junegunn/fzf-bin plugin from GitHub Releases, which contains only single file \u2013 the fzf binary for the selected architecture. It is possible to do it in the standard way \u2013 by adding the plugin's directory to the $PATH : zinit ice as\"command\" from\"github-rel\" zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin After this command, the $PATH variable will contain e.g.: % print $PATH /home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin For many such programs loaded as plugins the PATH can become quite cluttered. I've had 26 entries before switching to z-a-bin-gem-node . To solve this, load with use of fbin'' ice provided and handled by z-a-bin-gem-node : zinit ice from\"gh-r\" fbin\"fzf\" zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin The $PATH will remain unchanged and an fzf function will be created: % which fzf fzf () { local bindir=\"/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin\" \"$bindir\"/\"fzf\" \"$@\" } Running the function will forward the call to the program accessed through an embedded path to it. Thus, no $PATH changes are needed! The Ice Modifiers Provided By The Annex # There are 7 ice-modifiers provided and handled by the annex. They are: fbin'' \u2013 creates functions for binaries and scripts, sbin'' \u2013 creates shims for binaries and scripts, gem'' \u2013 installs and updates gems + creates functions for gems' binaries, node'' \u2013 installs and updates node_modules + creates functions for binaries of the modules, fmod'' \u2013 creates wrapping functions for other functions, fsrc'' \u2013 creates functions that source given scripts, ferc'' \u2013 the same as fsrc'' , but using an alternate script-loading method. The ice-modifiers in detail: 1. fbin'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{path-to-binary}[ -> {name-of-the-function}]; \u2026' # Creates a wrapper function of the name the same as the last segment of the path or as {name-of-the-function} . The optional preceding flags mean: g \u2013 set $GEM_HOME variable, n \u2013 set $NODE_PATH variable, c \u2013 cd to the plugin's directory before running the function and then cd back after it has been run, N \u2013 append &>/dev/null to the call of the binary, i.e. redirect both standard output and standard error to /dev/null , E \u2013 append 2>/dev/null to the call of the binary, i.e. redirect standard error to /dev/null , O \u2013 append >/dev/null to the call of the binary, i.e. redirect standard output to /dev/null . Example: % zinit ice from\"gh-r\" fbin\"g:fzf -> myfzf\" % zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin % which myfzf myfzf () { local bindir=\"/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin\" local -x GEM_HOME=\"/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin\" \"$bindir\"/\"fzf\" \"$@\" } 2. gem'{gem-name}; \u2026' # gem'[{path-to-binary} <-] !{gem-name} [-> {name-of-the-function}]; \u2026' # Installs the gem of name {gem-name} with $GEM_HOME set to the plugin's or snippet's directory. In other words, the gem and its dependencies will be installed locally in that directory. In the second form it also creates a wrapper function identical to the one created with fbin'' ice. Example: % zinit ice gem'!asciidoctor' % zinit load zdharma/null % which asciidoctor asciidoctor () { local bindir=\"/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/zdharma---null/bin\" local -x GEM_HOME=\"/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/zdharma---null\" \"$bindir\"/\"asciidoctor\" \"$@\" } 3. node'{node-module}; \u2026' # node'[{path-to-binary} <-] !{node-module} [-> {name-of-the-function}]; \u2026' # Installs the node module of name {node-module} inside the plugin's or snippet's directory. In the second form it also creates a wrapper function identical to the one created with fbin'' ice. Example: % zinit delete zdharma/null Delete /home/sg/.zinit/plugins/zdharma---null?

Avoiding forks was the main guideline when creating the projects and this lead to multiple discoveries of Zsh constructs that are fast, robust and do not depend on external tools. Such code is more like Ruby or Perl code, less like top-down shell scripts. Information # @ is about keeping array form # How to access all array elements in a shell? The standard answer: use @ subscript , i.e. ${array[@]} . However, this is the Bash & Ksh way (and with the option KSH_ARRAYS , Zsh also works this way, i.e. needs @ to access whole array). Zshell is different : it is $array that refers to all elements anyway. There is no need of @ subscript. So what use has @ in the Zsh-world? It is: \" keep array form \" or \" do not join \". When is it activated? When user quotes the array, i.e. invokes \"$array\" , he induces joining of all array elements (into a single string). @ is to have elements still quoted (so empty elements are preserved), but not joined. Two forms are available, \"$array[@]\" and \"${(@)array}\" . First form has additional effect \u2013 when option KSH_ARRAYS is set, it indeed induces referencing to whole array instead of first element only. It should then use braces, i.e. ${array[@]} , \"${array[@]}\" ( KSH_ARRAYS requirement). In practice, if you'll use @ as a subscript \u2013 [@] , not as a flag \u2013 ${(@)...} , then you'll make the code KSH_ARRAYS -compatible. extended_glob # Glob-flags #b and #m require setopt extended_glob . Patterns utilizing ~ and ^ also require it. Extended-glob is one of the main features of Zsh. Constructs # Reading a file # declare -a lines; lines=( \"${(@f)\"$(<path/file)\"}\" ) This preserves empty lines because of double-quoting (the outside one). @ -flag is used to obtain array instead of scalar. If you don't want empty lines preserved, you can also skip @ -splitting, as it is explained in Information section: declare -a lines; lines=( ${(f)\"$(<path/file)\"} ) Note: $(<...) construct strips trailing empty lines. Reading from stdin # This topic is governed by the same principles a the previous paragraph ( Reading a file ), with the single difference that instead of the substitution \"$(<file-path)\" the substitution that should be used is \"$(command arg1 ...)\" , i.e.: declare -a lines; lines=( ${(f)\"$(command arg1 ...)\"} ) This will read the command's output into the array lines . The version that does @ splitting and retains any empty lines is: declare -a lines; lines=( \"${(f@)$(command arg1 ...)}\" ) Note that instead of four double-quotes \" , an idiom that is justified (simply suggested) by the Zsh documentation (and was used in the previous paragraph, in the snippet ... \"${(@f)\"$(<path/file)\"}\" ... ), only two double-quotes are being used. I've investigated this form with the main Zsh developers on the zsh-workers@zsh.org mailing list, and it was clearly stated that single, outside quoting of ${(f@)...} substitution works as if it was also separately applied to $(command ...) (or to $(<file-path) ) inner substitution, so the second double-quoting isn't actually needed. Skipping grep # declare -a lines; lines=( \"${(@f)\"$(<path/file)\"}\" ) declare -a grepped; grepped=( ${(M)lines:#*query*} ) To have grep -v effect, skip M -flag. To grep case insensitively, use #i glob flag ( ...:#(#i)*query*} ). As it can be seen, ${...:#...} substitution is a filtering of array, which by default filters-out elements ( (M) flag induces the opposite behavior). When used with string, not an array, it behaves similarily: returns empty string when {input_string_var:#pattern} matches whole input string. Side-note: (M) flag can be used also with ${(M)var#pattern} and other substitutions, to retain what's matched by the pattern instead of removing that. Multi-line matching like with grep # Suppose you have a Subversion repository and want to check if it contains files being not under version control. You could do this in Bash style like follows: local svn_status=\"$(svn status)\" if [[ -n \"$(echo \"$svn_status\" | grep \\^\\?)\" ]]; then echo found fi That are 3 forks: for svn status , for echo and for grep . This can be solved by :# substitution and (M) flag described above in this section (just check if the number of matched lines is greater than 0). However, there's a more direct approach: local svn_status=\"$(svn status)\" nl=$'\\n' if [[ \"$svn_status\" = *((#s)|$nl)\\?* ]]; then echo found fi This requires extendedglob . The (#s) means: \"start of the string\". So ((#s)|$nl) means \"start of the string OR preceded by a new-line\". If the extendedglob option cannot be used for some reason, this can be achieved also without it, but essentially it means that alternative (i.e. | ) of two versions of the pattern will have to be matched: setopt localoptions noextendedglob local svn_status=\"$(svn status)\" nl=$'\\n' if [[ \"$svn_status\" = (\\?*|*$nl\\?*) ]]; then echo found fi In general, multi-line matching falls into the following idiom ( extendedglob version): local needle=\"?\" required_preceding='[[:space:]]#' [[ \"$(svn status)\" = *((#s)|$nl)${~required_preceding}${needle}* ]] && echo found It does a single fork (calls svn status ). The ${~variable} means (the ~ in it): \"the variable is holding a pattern, interpret it\". All in all, instead of regular expressions we were using patterns (globs) (see this section ). Pattern matching in AND-fashion # [[ \"abc xyz efg\" = *abc*~^*efg* ]] && print Match found The ~ is a negation -- match *abc* but not ... . Then, ^ is also a negation. The effect is: *abc* but not those that don't have *efg* which equals to: *abc* but those that have also *efg* . This is a regular pattern and it can be used with :# above to search arrays, or with R -subscript flag to search hashes ( ${hsh[(R)*pattern*]} ), etc. Inventor of those patterns is Mikael Magnusson. Skipping tr # declare -A map; map=( a 1 b 2 ); text=( \"ab\" \"ba\" ) text=( ${text[@]//(#m)?/${map[$MATCH]}} ) print $text \u25b6 12 21 #m flag enables the $MATCH parameter. At each // substitution, $map is queried for character-replacement. You can substitute a text variable too, just skip [@] and parentheses in assignment. Ternary expressions with +,-,:+,:- substitutions # HELP=\"yes\"; print ${${HELP:+help enabled}:-help disabled} \u25b6 help enabled HELP=\"\"; print ${${HELP:+help enabled}:-help disabled} \u25b6 help disabled Ternary expression is known from C language but exists also in Zsh, but directly only in math context, i.e. (( a = a > 0 ? b : c )) . Flexibility of Zsh allows such expressions also in normal context. Above is an example. :+ is \"if not empty, substitute \u2026\" :- is \"if empty, substitute \u2026\". You can save great number of lines of code with those substitutions, it's normally at least 4-lines if condition or lenghty && / || use. Ternary expressions with :# substitution # var=abc; print ${${${(M)var:#abc}:+is abc}:-not abc} \u25b6 is abc var=abcd; print ${${${(M)var:#abc}:+is abc}:-not abc} \u25b6 not abc An one-line \"if var = x, then \u2026, else \u2026\". Again, can spare a great amount of boring code that makes 10-line function a 20-line one. Using built-in regular expressions engine # [[ \"aabbb\" = (#b)(a##)*(b(#c2,2)) ]] && print ${match[1]}-${match[2]} \u25b6 aa-bb ## is: \"1 or more\". (#c2,2) is: \"exactly 2\". A few other constructs: # is \"0 or more\", ? is \"any character\", (a|b|) is \"a or b or empty match\". #b enables the $match parameters. There's also #m but it has one parameter $MATCH for whole matched text, not for any parenthesis. Zsh patterns are basically a custom regular expressions engine. They are slightly faster than zsh/regex module (used for =~ operator) and don't have that dependency (regex module can be not present, e.g. in default static build of Zsh). Also, they can be used in substitutions, for example in // substitution. Skipping uniq # declare -aU array; array=( a a b ); print $array \u25b6 a b declare -a array; array=( a a b ); print ${(u)array} \u25b6 a b Enable -U flag for array so that it guards elements to be unique, or use u -flag to uniquify elements of any array. Skipping awk # declare -a list; list=( \"a,b,c,1,e\" \"p,q,r,2,t\" ); print \"${list[@]/(#b)([^,]##,)(#c3,3)([^,]##)*/${match[2]}}\" \u25b6 1 2 The pattern specifies 3 blocks of [^,]##, so 3 \"not-comma multiple times, then comma\", then single block of \"not-comma multiple times\" in second parentheses -- and then replaces this with second parentheses. Result is 4 th column extracted from multiple lines of text, something awk is often used for. Other method is use of s -flag. For single line of text: text=\"a,b,c,1,e\"; print ${${(s:,:)text}[4]} \u25b6 1 Thanks to in-substitution code-execution capabilities it's possible to use s -flag to apply it to multiple lines: declare -a list; list=( \"a,b,c,1,e\" \"p,q,r,2,t\" ); print \"${list[@]/(#m)*/${${(s:,:)MATCH}[4]}}\" \u25b6 1 2 There is a problem with the (s::) flag that can be solved if Zsh is version 5.4 or higher: if there will be single input column, e.g. list=( \"column1\" \"a,b\") instead of two or more columns (i.e. list=( \"column1,column2\" \"a,b\" ) ), then (s::) will return string instead of 1-element array . So the index [4] in above snippet will index a string, and show its 4-th letter. Starting with Zsh 5.4, thanks to a patch by Bart Schaefer ( 40640: the (A) parameter flag forces array result even if... ), it is possible to force array -kind of result even for single column, by adding (A) flag, i.e.: declare -a list; list=( \"a,b,c,1,e\" \"p,q,r,2,t\" \"column1\" ); print \"${list[@]/(#m)*/${${(As:,:)MATCH}[4]}}\" \u25b6 1 2 print \"${list[@]/(#m)*/${${(s:,:)MATCH}[4]}}\" \u25b6 1 2 u Side-note: (A) flag is often used together with ::= assignment-substitution and (P) flag, to assign arrays and hashes by-name. Searching arrays # declare -a array; array=( a b \" c1\" d ); print ${array[(r)[[:space:]][[:alpha:]]*]} \u25b6 c1 [[:space:]] contains unicode spaces. This is often used in conditional expression like [[ -z ${array[(r)...]} ]] . Note that Skipping grep that uses :# substitution can also be used to search arrays. Code execution in // substitution # append() { gathered+=( $array[$1] ); } functions -M append 1 1 append declare -a array; array=( \"Value 1\" \"Other data\" \"Value 2\" ) declare -a gathered; integer idx=0 : ${array[@]/(#b)(Value ([[:digit:]]##)|*)/$(( ${#match[2]} > 0 ? append(++idx) : ++idx ))} print $gathered \u25b6 Value 1 Value 2 Use of #b glob flag enables math-code execution (and not only) in / and // substitutions. Implementation is very fast. Serializing data # declare -A hsh deserialized; hsh=( key value ) serialized=\"${(j: :)${(qkv@)hsh}}\" deserialized=( \"${(Q@)${(z@)serialized}}\" ) print ${(kv)deserialized} \u25b6 key value j -flag means join -- by spaces, in this case. Flags kv mean: keys and values, interleaving. Important q -flag means: quote. So what is obtained is each key and value quoted, and put into string separated by spaces. z -flag means: split as if Zsh parser would split. So quoting (with backslashes, double quoting and other) is recognized. Obtained is array ( \"key\" \"value\") which is then dequoted with Q -flag. This yields original data, assigned to hash deserialized . Use this to e.g. implement array of hashes. Note: to be compatible with setopt ksharrays , use [@] instead of (@) , e.g.: ...( \"${(Q)${(z)serialized[@]}[@]}\" ) Tip: serializing with Bash # array=( key1 key2 ) printf -v serialized \"%q \" \"${array[@]}\" eval \"deserialized=($serialized)\" This method works also with Zsh. The drawback is use of eval , however it's impossible that any problem will occurr unless someone compromises variable's value, but as always, eval should be avoided if possible. Real world examples # Testing for Git subcommand # Following code checks if there is a git subcommand $mysub : if git help -a | grep \"^ [a-z]\" | tr ' ' '\\n' | grep -x $mysub > /dev/null > /dev/null; then That are 4 forks. The code can be replaced according to this guide: local -a lines_list lines_list=( ${(f)\"$(git help -a)\"} ) lines_list=( ${(M)${(s: :)${(M)lines_list:# [a-z]*}}:#$mysub} ) if (( ${#lines_list} > 0 )); then The result is just 1 fork. Counting unquoted-only apostrophes # A project was needing this to do some Zle line-continuation tricks (when you put a backslash-\\ at the end of the line and press enter \u2013 it is the line-continuation that occurs at that moment). The required functionality is: in given string, count the number of apostrophes, but only the unquoted ones . This means that only apostrophes with null or an even number of preceding backslashes should be accepted into the count: buf=\"word'continue\\'after\\\\\\'afterSecnd\\\\''afterPair\" integer count=0 : ${buf//(#b)((#s)|[^\\\\])([\\\\][\\\\])#(\\'\\'#)/$(( count += ${#match[3]} ))} echo $count \u25b6 3 The answer (i.e. the output) to the above presentation and example is: 3 (there are 3 unquoted apostrophes in total in the string kept in the variable $buf ). Below follows a variation of above snippet that doesn't use math-code execution: buf=\"word'continue\\'after\\\\\\'afterSecnd\\\\''afterPair\" buf=\"${(S)buf//(#b)*((#s)|[^\\\\])([\\\\][\\\\])#(\\'\\'#)*/${match[3]}}\"; buf=${buf%%[^\\']##} integer count=${#buf} echo $count \u25b6 3 This is possible thanks to (S) flag \u2013 non-greedy matching, ([\\\\][\\\\])# trick \u2013 it matches only unquoted following (\\'\\'##) characters (which are the apostrophes) and a general strategy to replace anything-apostrope(s) (unquoted ones) with the-apostrope(s) (and then count them with ${#buf} ). Tips and Tricks # Parsing INI file # With Zshell's extended_glob parsing an ini file is an easy task. It will not result in a nested-arrays data structure (Zsh doesn't support nested hashes), but the hash keys like $DB_CONF[db1_<connection>_host] are actually really intuitive.

Zinit fully supports this standard. This document is also available as a PDF . What Is A Zsh Plugin? # Historically, Zsh plugins were first defined by Oh My Zsh. They provide for a way to package together files that extend or configure the shell\u2019s functionality in a particular way. At a simple level, a plugin: Has its directory added to $fpath ( Zsh documentation ). This is being done either by a plugin manager or by the plugin itself (see 5 th section for more information). Has its first *.plugin.zsh file sourced (or *.zsh , init.zsh , *.sh , these are non-standard). The first point allows plugins to provide completions and functions that are loaded via Zsh\u2019s autoload mechanism (a single function per-file). From a more broad perspective, a plugin consists of: A directory containing various files (main script, autoload functions, completions, Makefiles, backend programs, documentation). A sourcable script that obtains the path to its directory via $0 (see the next section for a related enhancement proposal). A Github (or other site) repository identified by two components username / pluginname . A software package containing any type of command line artifacts \u2013 when used with advanced plugin managers that have hooks, can run Makefiles, add directories to $PATH . Below follow proposed enhancements and codifications of the definition of a \"Zsh plugin\" and the actions of plugin managers \u2013 the proposed standardization. They cover the information of how to write a Zsh plugin. 1. Standardized $0 Handling # To get the plugin\u2019s location, plugins should do: 0=\"${${ZERO:-${0:#$ZSH_ARGZERO}}:-${(%):-%N}}\" 0=\"${${(M)0:#/*}:-$PWD/$0}\" # Then ${0:h} to get plugin\u2019s directory The one-line code above will: Be backwards-compatible with normal $0 setting and usage. Use ZERO if it\u2019s not empty, the plugin manager will be easily able to alter effective $0 before loading a plugin, this allows for e.g. eval \"$(<plugin)\" , which can be faster than source ( comparison , note that it\u2019s not for a compiled script). Use $0 if it doesn\u2019t contain the path to the Zsh binary, plugin manager will still be able to set $0 , although more difficultly (requires unsetopt function_argzero before sourcing plugin script, and 0=\u2026\u200b assignment), unsetopt function_argzero will be detected (it causes $0 not to contain plugin-script path, but path to Zsh binary, if not overwritten by a 0=\u2026\u200b assignment), setopt posix_argzero will be detected (as above). Use %N prompt expansion flag, which always gives absolute path to script, plugin manager cannot alter this (no advanced loading of plugin is possible), but simple plugin-file sourcing (without a plugin manager) will be saved from breaking caused by the mentioned *_argzero options, so this is a very good last-resort fallback. Finally, in the second line, it will ensure that $0 contains an absolute path by prepending it with $PWD if necessary. The goal is flexibility, with essential motivation to support eval \"$(<plugin)\" and definitely solve setopt no_function_argzero and setopt posix_argzero cases. A plugin manager will be even able to convert a plugin to a function (author implemented such proof of concept functionality, it\u2019s fully possible \u2013 also in an automatic fashion), but performance differences of this are yet unclear. It might however provide a use case. The last, 5 th point also allows to use the $0 handling in scripts (i.e. runnables with the hashbang #!\u2026 ) to get the directory in which the script file resides. The assignment uses quoting to make it resilient to combination of GLOB_SUBST and GLOB_ASSIGN options. It's a standard snippet of code, so it has to be always working. When you'll set e.g.: the zsh emulation in a function, you in general don't have to quote assignments. Adoption Status # Plugin managers: Zinit, Zgen (after and if the PR will be merged) Plugins: GitHub search 2. Unload Function # If a plugin is named e.g. kalc (and is available via an-user/kalc plugin-ID), then it can provide a function, kalc_plugin_unload , that can be called by a plugin manager to undo the effects of loading that plugin. A plugin manager can implement its own tracking of changes made by a plugin so this is in general optional. However, to properly unload e.g. a prompt, dedicated tracking (easy to do for the plugin creator) can provide better, predictable results. Any special, uncommon effects of loading a plugin are possible to undo only by a dedicated function. However, an interesting compromise approach is available \u2013 to withdraw only the special effects of loading a plugin via the dedicated, plugin-provided function and leave the rest to the plugin manager. The value of such approach is that maintaining of such function (if it is to withdraw all plugin side-effects) can be a daunting task requiring constant monitoring of it during the plugin develoment process. Adoption Status # One plugin manager, Zinit, implements plugin unloading and calls the function. One plugin, romkatv/powerlevel10k , is Two plugins: romkatv/powerlevel10k , is using the function to execute a specific task: shutdown of the binary, background gitstatus demon, with a very good results, agkozak/agkozak-zsh-prompt , is using the function for the full unload of the theme. 3. @zsh-plugin-run-on-unload Call # The plugin manager can provide a function @zsh-plugin-run-on-unload which has the following call syntax: @zsh-plugin-run-on-unload \"{code-snippet-1}\" \"{code-snippet-2}\" \u2026 The function registers pieces of code to be run by the plugin manager on unload of the plugin . The execution of the code should be done by the eval builtin in the same order as they are passed to the call. The code should be executed in the plugin's directory, in the current shell. The mechanism thus provides another way, side to the unload function , for the plugin to participate in the process of unloading it. Adoption Status # It's a recent addition to the standard and only one plugin manager, Zinit, implements it. 4. @zsh-plugin-run-on-update Call # The plugin manager can provide a function @zsh-plugin-run-on-update which has the following call syntax: @zsh-plugin-run-on-update \"{code-snippet-1}\" \"{code-snippet-2}\" \u2026 The function registers pieces of code to be run by the plugin manager on update of the plugin . The execution of the code should be done by the eval builtin in the same order as they are passed to the call. The code should be executed in the plugin's directory, possibly in a subshell. Adoption Status # It's a recent addition to the standard and only one plugin manager, Zinit, implements it. 5. Plugin Manager Activity Indicator # Plugin managers should set the $zsh_loaded_plugins array to contain all previously loaded plugins and the plugin currently being loaded (as the last element). This will allow any plugin to: Check which plugins are already loaded. Check if it is being loaded by a plugin manager (i.e. not just sourced). The first item allows a plugin to e.g. issue a notice about missing dependencies. Instead of issuing a notice, it may be able to satisfy the dependencies from resources it provides. For example, pure prompt provides zsh-async dependency library within its source tree, which is normally a separate project. Consequently, the prompt can decide to source its private copy of zsh-async , having also reliable $0 defined by previous section (note: pure doesn\u2019t normally do this). The second item allows a plugin to e.g. set up $fpath , knowing that plugin manager will not handle this: if [[ ${zsh_loaded_plugins[-1]} != */kalc && -z ${fpath[(r)${0:h}]} ]] then fpath+=( \"${0:h}\" ) fi This will allow user to reliably source the plugin without using a plugin manager. The code uses the wrapping braces around variables (i.e.: e.g.: ${fpath\u2026} ) to make it compatible with the KSH_ARRAYS option and the quoting around ${0:h} to make it compatible with the SH_WORD_SPLIT option. Adoption Status # Plugin managers: Zinit, Zgen (after and if the PR will be merged) Plugins: GitHub search 5. Global Parameter With PREFIX For Make, Configure, Etc. # Plugin managers may export the parameter $ZPFX which should contain a path to a directory dedicated for user-land software, i.e. for directories $ZPFX/bin , $ZPFX/lib , $ZPFX/share , etc. Suggested name of the directory is polaris , Zinit uses this name and places this directory at ~/.zinit/polaris by default. User can then configure hooks (feature of e.g. zplug and Zinit) to invoke e.g. make PREFIX=$ZPFX install at clone & update of the plugin to install software like e.g. tj/git-extras . This is a developing role of Zsh plugin managers as package managers, where .zshrc has a similar role to Chef or Puppet configuration and allows to declare system state, and have the same state on different accounts / machines. No-narration facts-list related to $ZPFX : export ZPFX=\"$HOME/polaris\" (or e.g. $HOME/.zinit/polaris ) make PREFIX=$ZPFX install ./configure --prefix=$ZPFX cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ZPFX . zinit ice make\"PREFIX=$ZPFX install\" zplug \u2026 hook-build:\"make PREFIX=$PFX install\" Adoption Status # One plugin manager, Zinit, provides the $ZPFX parameter. Zsh Plugin-Programming Best Practices # The document is to define a Zsh-plugin but also to serve as an information source for plugin creators. Therefore, it covers also a best practices information in this section. Use Of add-zsh-hook To Install Hooks # Zsh ships with a function add-zsh-hook . It has the following invocation syntax: add-zsh-hook [ -L | -dD ] [ -Uzk ] hook function The command installs a function as one of the supported zsh hook entries. which are one of: chpwd , periodic , precmd , preexec , zshaddhistory , zshexit , zsh_directory_name . For their meaning refer to the Zsh documentation . Use Of add-zle-hook-widget To Install Zle Hooks # Zle editor is the part of the Zsh that is responsible for receiving the text from the user. It can be said that it\u2019s based on widgets, which are nothing more than Zsh functions that are allowed to be ran in Zle context, i.e. from the Zle editor (plus a few minor differences, like e.g.: the $WIDGET parameter that\u2019s automatically set by the Zle editor). The syntax of the call is: add-zle-hook-widget [ -L | -dD ] [ -Uzk ] hook widgetname The call resembles the syntax of the add-zsh-hook function. The only difference is that it takes a widgetname , not a function name, and that the hook is being one of: isearch-exit , isearch-update , line-pre-redraw , line-init , line-finish , history-line-set , or keymap-select . Their meaning is explained in the Zsh documentation . The use of this function is recommended because it allows to install multiple hooks per each hook entry. Before introducing the add-zle-hook-widget function the \"normal\" way to install a hook was to define widget with the name of one of the special widgets. Now, after the function has been introduced in Zsh 5.3 it should be used instead. Standard Recommended Options # The following code snippet is recommended to be included at the beginning of each of the main functions provided by the plugin: emulate -L zsh setopt extended_glob warn_create_global typeset_silent \\ no_short_loops rc_quotes no_auto_pushd It resets all the options to their default state according to the zsh emulation mode, with use of the local_options option \u2013 so the options will be restored to their previous state when leaving the function. It then alters the emulation by 6 different options: extended_glob \u2013 enables one of the main Zshell features \u2013 the advanced, built-in regex-like globing mechanism, warn_create_global \u2013 enables warnings to be printed each time a (global) variable is defined without being explicitly defined by a typeset , local , declare , etc. call; it allows to catch typos and missing localizations of the variables and thus prevents from writing a bad code, typeset_silent \u2013 it allows to call typeset , local , etc. multiple times on the same variable; without it the second call causes the variable contents to be printed first; using this option allows to declare variables inside loops, near the place of their use, which sometimes helps to write a more readable code, no_short_loops \u2013 disables the short-loops syntax; this is done because when the syntax is enabled it limits the parser's ability to detect errors (see this zsh-workers post for the details), rc_quotes \u2013 adds useful ability to insert apostrophes into an apostrophe-quoted string, by use of '' inside it, e.g.: 'a string''s example' will yield the string a string's example , no_auto_pushd - disables the automatic push of the directory passed to cd builtin onto the directory stack; this is useful, because otherwise the internal directory changes done by the plugin will pollute the global directory stack. Standard Recommended Variables # It's good to localize the following variables at the entry of the main function of a plugin: local MATCH REPLY; integer MBEGIN MEND local -a match mbegin mend reply The variables starting with m and M are being used by the substitutions utilizing (#b) and (#m) flags, respectively. They should not leak to the global scope. Also, their automatic creation would trigger the warning from the warn_create_global option. The reply and REPLY parameters are being normally used to return an array or a scalar from a function, respectively \u2013 it's the standard way of passing values from functions. Their use is naturally limited to the functions called from the main function of a plugin \u2013 they should not be used to pass data around e.g.: in between prompts, thus it's natural to localize them in the main function. Standard Function Name-Space Prefixes # The recommendation is purely subjective opinion of the author. It can evolve \u2013 if you have any remarks, don't hesitate to fill them . The Problems Solved By The Proposition # However when adopted, the proposition will solve the following issues: Using the underscore _ to namespace functions \u2013 this isn't the right thing to do because the prefix is being already used by the completion functions, so the namespace is already filled up greatly and the plugin functions get lost in it. Not using a prefix at all \u2013 this is also an unwanted practice as it pollutes the command namespace ( an example of such issue appearing). It would allow to quickly discriminate between function types \u2013 e.g.: seeing the : prefix informs the user that it's a hook-type function, while seeing the @ prefix informs the user that it's an API-like function, etc. It also provides an improvement during programming, by allowing to quickly limit the number of completions offered by the editor, e.g.: for Vim's Ctrl-P completing, when entering +<Ctrl-P> , then only a subset of the functions is being completed (see below for the type of the functions). Note: the editor has to be configured so that it accepts such special characters as part of keywords, for Vim it's: :set isk+=@-@,.,+,/,: for all of the proposed prefixes. The Proposed Function-Name Prefixes # The proposition of the standard prefixes is as follows: . : for regular private functions. Example function: .prompt_zinc_get_value . : : for hook-like functions, so it should be used e.g.: for the Zsh hooks and the Zle hooks , but also for any other custom hook-like mechanism in the plugin (e.g.: Zinit annexes use such prefix for the Zinit hook functions). Example function name: :prompt_zinc_precmd . + : for output functions, i.e.: for functions that print to the standard output and error or to a log, etc. Example function name: +prompt_zinc_output_segment . / : for debug functions, i.e: for functions that output debug messages to the screen or to a log or e.g.: gather some debug data. Note: the slash makes it impossible for such functions to be auto-loaded via the autoload mechanism. It is somewhat risky to assume, that this will never be needed for the functions, however the limited number of available ASCII characters justifies such allocation. Example function name: /prompt_zinc_dmsg . @ : for API-like functions, i.e: for functions that are on a boundary to a subsystem and expose its functionality through a well-defined, in general fixed interface. For example this plugin standard defines the function @zsh-plugin-run-on-update , which is exposing a plugin manager's functionality in a well-defined way. Example Code Utilizing The Prefixes # .zinc_register_hooks() { add-zsh-hook precmd :zinc_precmd /zinc_dmsg \"Installed precmd hook with result: $?\" @zsh-plugin-run-on-unload \"add-zsh-hook -d precmd :zinc_precmd\" +zinc_print \"Zinc initialization complete\" } Preventing Function Pollution # When writing a larger autoload function, it very often is the case that the function contains definitions of other functions. When the main function finishes executing, the functions are being left defined. This might be undesired, e.g.: because of the command name-space pollution. The following snippet of code, when added at the beginning of the main function will automatically unset the sub-functions when leaving the main function: # Don't leak any functions typeset -g prjef prjef=( ${(k)functions} ) trap \"unset -f -- \\\"\\${(k)functions[@]:|prjef}\\\" &>/dev/null; unset prjef\" EXIT trap \"unset -f -- \\\"\\${(k)functions[@]:|prjef}\\\" &>/dev/null; unset prjef; return 1\" INT Replace the prj* prefix with your project name, e.g.: rustef for a rust -related plugin. The *ef stands for \"entry functions\". The snippet works as follows: The line prjef=( ${(k)functions} ) remembers all the functions that are currently defined \u2013 which means that the list excludes the functions that are to be yet defined by the body of the main function. The code unset -f -- \"${(k)functions[@]:|prjef}\" first does an subtraction of array contents \u2013 the :| substitution operator \u2013 of the functions that are defined at the moment of leaving of the function (the trap -s invoke the code in this moment) with the list of functions from the start of the main function \u2013 the ones stored in the variables $prjef . It then unsets the resulting list of the functions \u2013 being only the newly defined functions in the main function \u2013 by passing it to unset -f \u2026 . This way the functions defined by the body of the main (most often an autoload) function will be only set during the execution of the function. Preventing Parameter Pollution # When writing a plugin one often needs to keep a state during the Zsh session. To do this it is natural to use global parameters. However, when the number of the parameters grows one might want to limit it.

They provide for a way to package together files that extend or configure the shell\u2019s functionality in a particular way. At a simple level, a plugin: Has its directory added to $fpath ( Zsh documentation ). This is being done either by a plugin manager or by the plugin itself (see 5 th section for more information). Has its first *.plugin.zsh file sourced (or *.zsh , init.zsh , *.sh , these are non-standard). The first point allows plugins to provide completions and functions that are loaded via Zsh\u2019s autoload mechanism (a single function per-file). From a more broad perspective, a plugin consists of: A directory containing various files (main script, autoload functions, completions, Makefiles, backend programs, documentation). A sourcable script that obtains the path to its directory via $0 (see the next section for a related enhancement proposal). A Github (or other site) repository identified by two components username / pluginname . A software package containing any type of command line artifacts \u2013 when used with advanced plugin managers that have hooks, can run Makefiles, add directories to $PATH . Below follow proposed enhancements and codifications of the definition of a \"Zsh plugin\" and the actions of plugin managers \u2013 the proposed standardization. They cover the information of how to write a Zsh plugin.","title":"What Is A Zsh Plugin?"},{"location":"zsh-plugin-standard/#146_standardized_0_handling","text":"To get the plugin\u2019s location, plugins should do: 0=\"${${ZERO:-${0:#$ZSH_ARGZERO}}:-${(%):-%N}}\" 0=\"${${(M)0:#/*}:-$PWD/$0}\" # Then ${0:h} to get plugin\u2019s directory The one-line code above will: Be backwards-compatible with normal $0 setting and usage. Use ZERO if it\u2019s not empty, the plugin manager will be easily able to alter effective $0 before loading a plugin, this allows for e.g. eval \"$(<plugin)\" , which can be faster than source ( comparison , note that it\u2019s not for a compiled script). Use $0 if it doesn\u2019t contain the path to the Zsh binary, plugin manager will still be able to set $0 , although more difficultly (requires unsetopt function_argzero before sourcing plugin script, and 0=\u2026\u200b assignment), unsetopt function_argzero will be detected (it causes $0 not to contain plugin-script path, but path to Zsh binary, if not overwritten by a 0=\u2026\u200b assignment), setopt posix_argzero will be detected (as above). Use %N prompt expansion flag, which always gives absolute path to script, plugin manager cannot alter this (no advanced loading of plugin is possible), but simple plugin-file sourcing (without a plugin manager) will be saved from breaking caused by the mentioned *_argzero options, so this is a very good last-resort fallback. Finally, in the second line, it will ensure that $0 contains an absolute path by prepending it with $PWD if necessary. The goal is flexibility, with essential motivation to support eval \"$(<plugin)\" and definitely solve setopt no_function_argzero and setopt posix_argzero cases. A plugin manager will be even able to convert a plugin to a function (author implemented such proof of concept functionality, it\u2019s fully possible \u2013 also in an automatic fashion), but performance differences of this are yet unclear. It might however provide a use case. The last, 5 th point also allows to use the $0 handling in scripts (i.e. runnables with the hashbang #!\u2026 ) to get the directory in which the script file resides. The assignment uses quoting to make it resilient to combination of GLOB_SUBST and GLOB_ASSIGN options. It's a standard snippet of code, so it has to be always working. When you'll set e.g.: the zsh emulation in a function, you in general don't have to quote assignments.","title":"1.

A plugin manager can implement its own tracking of changes made by a plugin so this is in general optional. However, to properly unload e.g. a prompt, dedicated tracking (easy to do for the plugin creator) can provide better, predictable results. Any special, uncommon effects of loading a plugin are possible to undo only by a dedicated function. However, an interesting compromise approach is available \u2013 to withdraw only the special effects of loading a plugin via the dedicated, plugin-provided function and leave the rest to the plugin manager. The value of such approach is that maintaining of such function (if it is to withdraw all plugin side-effects) can be a daunting task requiring constant monitoring of it during the plugin develoment process.","title":"2.

The first item allows a plugin to e.g. issue a notice about missing dependencies. Instead of issuing a notice, it may be able to satisfy the dependencies from resources it provides. For example, pure prompt provides zsh-async dependency library within its source tree, which is normally a separate project. Consequently, the prompt can decide to source its private copy of zsh-async , having also reliable $0 defined by previous section (note: pure doesn\u2019t normally do this). The second item allows a plugin to e.g. set up $fpath , knowing that plugin manager will not handle this: if [[ ${zsh_loaded_plugins[-1]} != */kalc && -z ${fpath[(r)${0:h}]} ]] then fpath+=( \"${0:h}\" ) fi This will allow user to reliably source the plugin without using a plugin manager.
