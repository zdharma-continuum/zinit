This is the Zplugin wiki. The goal is to complement the
[**README**](https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin/blob/master/README.md) by providing
a more easy to approach, more intuitively organized (with help of the
[**MkDocs**](https://www.mkdocs.org/) project documentation tool) and also a more
in-depth information.
