This test verifies:

1. atpull being run at update (TODO: verify if not at clone)

2. That update is using saved ice – not distinguished if from files or ZINIT_SICE (_test6 will check this)

3. Ice not surviving to second command

4. Static ice surviving to second command

5. ._zinit/atpull file having correct contents
