==== .zinit-any-colorify-as-uspl2

____

 plugin spec (user---plugin, user/plugin, user plugin, plugin).
 
 $1 - plugin spec (4 formats: user---plugin, user/plugin, user, plugin)
 $2 - plugin (only when $1 - i.e. user - given)
 
 $REPLY - ANSI-colorified "user/plugin" string

==== .zinit-compute-ice

____
 
 Computes ICE array
 - input
 - static
 - saved
 taking priorities into account.
 Can also pack resulting ices into ZINIT_SICE (see $2).
 Returns filepath to snippet directory and optional snippet file name (only
 valid if ICE[svn] is not set).
 
 $1 - URL (also plugin-spec)
 $2 - "pack" or "nopack" or "pack-nf" - packing means ICE
 wins with static ice; "pack-nf" means that disk-ices will
 be ignored (no-file?)
 $3 - name of output associative array, "ICE" is the default
 $4 - name of output string parameter, to hold path to directory ("local_dir")
 $5 - name of output string parameter, to hold filename ("filename")
 $6 - name of output string parameter, to hold is-snippet 0/1-bool ("is_snippet")
 
 $REPLY - snippet directory filepath

==== .zinit-exists-physically-message

____
 
 Checks if directory of given plugin exists in PLUGIN_DIR, and outputs error
 message if it doesn't.
 
 $1 - plugin spec (4 formats: user---plugin, user/plugin, user, plugin)
 $2 - plugin (only when $1 - i.e. user - given)

==== .zinit-first

____
 
 Finds the main file of plugin. There are multiple file name formats, they are
 ordered in order starting from more correct ones, and matched.
 .zinit-load-plugin() has similar code parts and doesn't call .zinit-first() –
 for performance. Obscure matching is done in .zinit-find-other-matches, here
 and in .zinit-load(). Obscure = non-standard main-file naming convention.
 
 $1 - plugin spec (4 formats: user---plugin, user/plugin, user, plugin)
 $2 - plugin (only when $1 - i.e. user - given)

==== .zinit-store-ices

____
 
 Saves ice mods in given hash onto disk.
 
 $1 - directory where to create or delete files
 $2 - name of hash that holds values
 $3 - additional keys of hash to store, space separated
 $4 - additional keys of hash to store, empty-meaningful ices, space separated
 $5 – URL, if applicable
 $6 – mode, svn=1, 0=single file

==== .zinit-two-paths

____
 
 Obtains a snippet URL without specification if it is an SVN URL (points to
 directory) or regular URL (points to file), returns 2 possible paths for
 further examination
 
 $REPLY - two filepaths
