Has 1 line(s). No functions are called (may set up e.g. a hook, a Zle widget bound to a key, etc.).

.zinit-any-colorify-as-uspl2

____
 
 FUNCTION: .zinit-any-colorify-as-uspl2 [[[
 Returns ANSI-colorified "user/plugin" string, from any supported
 plugin spec (user---plugin, user/plugin, user plugin, plugin).
 
 $1 - plugin spec (4 formats: user---plugin, user/plugin, user, plugin)
 $2 - plugin (only when $1 - i.e. user - given)
 $REPLY = ANSI-colorified "user/plugin" string

 ]]]
 FUNCTION: .zinit-compute-ice [[[
 Computes ICE array (default, it can be specified via $3) from a) input
 ICE, b) static ice, c) saved ice, taking priorities into account. Also
 returns path to snippet directory and optional name of snippet file (only
 valid if ICE[svn] is not set).
 
 Can also pack resulting ices into ZINIT_SICE (see $2).
 
 $1 - URL (also plugin-spec)
 $2 - "pack" or "nopack" or "pack-nf" - packing means ICE
 wins with static ice; "pack-nf" means that disk-ices will
 be ignored (no-file?)
 $3 - name of output associative array, "ICE" is the default
 $4 - name of output string parameter, to hold path to directory ("local_dir")
 $5 - name of output string parameter, to hold filename ("filename")
 $6 - name of output string parameter, to hold is-snippet 0/1-bool ("is_snippet")

~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 FUNCTION: .zinit-first [[[
 Finds the main file of plugin. There are multiple file name
 formats, they are ordered in order starting from more correct
 ones, and matched. .zinit-load-plugin() has similar code parts
 and doesn't call .zinit-first() – for performance. Obscure matching
 is done in .zinit-find-other-matches, here and in .zinit-load().
 Obscure = non-standard main-file naming convention.

zmv
~~~

____
 
 function zmv {
 zmv, zcp, zln:
 
 This is a multiple move based on zsh pattern matching.  To get the full
 power of it, you need a postgraduate degree in zsh.  However, simple
 tasks work OK, so if that's all you need, here are some basic examples:
 zmv '(*).txt' '$1.lis'
 Rename foo.txt to foo.lis, etc.  The parenthesis is the thing that
 gets replaced by the $1 (not the `*', as happens in mmv, and note the
 `$', not `=', so that you need to quote both words).
____

Has 299 line(s). Doesn't call other functions.

Not called by script or any function (may be e.g. a hook, a Zle widget, etc.).
