=== DETAILS

==== Script Body

Has 6 line(s). No functions are called (may set up e.g. a hook, a Zle widget bound to a key, etc.).

Uses feature(s): _source_

==== +zinit-cmake-hook

Has 1 line(s). Calls functions:

 +zinit-cmake-hook
 `-- __zinit-cmake-base-hook
     `-- zinit.zsh/+zi-log

Not called by script or any function (may be e.g. a hook, a Zle widget, etc.).

==== .zi::get-architecture

Has 39 line(s). Calls functions:

 .zi::get-architecture
 `-- zinit.zsh/+zi-log

Uses feature(s): _setopt_

Not called by script or any function (may be e.g. a hook, a Zle widget, etc.).

 that it runs normal `compinit', which should more easily detect
 Zinit's completions.
